										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>HR managers, is your company Brexit-ready?</p>



<p>As Britain prepares to leave the European Union, it’s
important for UK companies employing EU workers to ensure they’re ready for the
changes that will follow. Those responsible for recruitment should be aware of
these changes and understand what they mean for both the company’s current EU
employees and its future recruitment strategy.&nbsp;
</p>



<p>Some steps that can be taken to ensure a smooth transition
for businesses and their employees include:</p>



<p><strong>Keeping your current
EU workers</strong></p>



<p>Firstly, it’s important to ensure that any EU, EEA or Swiss
nationals currently employed by your company can continue to stay in the UK
after 30th June 2021 (if a deal is not agreed, the deadline will be 31st
December 2020). The government’s EU Settlement Scheme gives these people the
opportunity to apply to continue living in the UK following its exit from the
European Union. Applicants who have been here for five years or more will
receive ‘settled’ status, while those who have lived here for less than five
years will get ‘pre-settled’ status.</p>



<p>The process is free, and the government has provided a step-by-step set of instructions on its website to guide applicants. HR officers should familiarise themselves with the process so that they can advise and support any of their company’s employees who need to apply. You can visit the site <strong><a href="https://www.gov.uk/eusettledstatus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="here (opens in a new tab)">here</a></strong>. </p>



<p><strong>Preparing to recruit
from outside the EU</strong></p>



<p>Once Brexit has taken place, the process of hiring workers
from the EU will become more difficult. As a result, companies may choose to
start recruiting people from further afield, although they will need to prepare
for this shift in focus.</p>



<p>According to a recent survey, 76% of businesses have no
contingency funds for future recruitment outside the EU. The cost, in terms of
both money and time, of sponsorship licences and Tier 2 Visas means companies
must determine whether they can afford to hire from abroad, as well as identify
the resources necessary to carry out their recruitment plans.</p>



<p><strong>What is a Tier 2 (General)
Visa and why do workers need them?</strong></p>



<p>Tier 2 (General) Visas are the most common type of visa.
They apply to skilled workers earning £30,000 a year and upwards, and require
sponsorship from the company offering employment. Proof of sponsorship comes in
the form of a certificate of sponsorship (CoS).</p>



<p>Once Britain has left the EU, EU citizens without settled or
pre-settled UK status may be subject to the same rules that apply to people
from the rest of the world, meaning they will need to apply for a Tier 2 Visa
if they intend to work in the UK.</p>



<p><strong>How much does an
overseas Tier 2 Visa application cost for a single applicant on a 3-year
contract?</strong></p>



<ul><li>Application fee &#8211; £610 </li><li>Immigration health charge &#8211; £1,200</li><li>Immigration skills charge (per year of contract)
£1,092 to £3,000 (depending on whether your company is categorised as large or
small)</li><li>Certificate of Sponsorship £199 </li><li>Priority visa service £220</li></ul>



<p>Due to the cost, complexity, and
potential pitfalls of the visa application process, recruiters would be wise to
work with an expert in the field. At Sunico Immigration, our team guides companies
through the hurdles of bringing staff into the UK, and facilitates the movement
of employees globally.</p>



<p>Our experience allows us to assess
eligibility quickly and to spot issues before they develop into problems,
providing clients with practical and commercial solutions.</p>



<p>Our services include:</p>



<ul><li>Advising on all aspects of the points-based system and
     assisting with the sponsor registration process</li><li>Work and business routes, including those for sponsored
     workers, business visitors, permitted paid engagement visitors, investors,
     entrepreneurs, high value migrants and representatives of overseas
     businesses</li><li>European applications such as family permits and
     permanent residence, and other applications including dependent family
     members and British nationality</li><li>Prevention of illegal working including audits of right
     to work documents, staff training, hotline services and objections to
     fines</li><li>Challenging decisions via administrative review</li></ul>



<p>If you need help understanding how Brexit will affect your
company’s EU nationals and overseas recruitment, our friendly and knowledgeable
team is ready to answer your questions. <strong><a href="https://sunicoimmigration.com/">Get in touch</a></strong> now to arrange a free

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having announced earlier in the year that our fees would remain unchanged for 2019, the additional work and time involved managing Tier 2 visa applications here in the UK has now become more onerous even than managing out-of-country applications – which we charged a higher figure for previously.</p>
<p>It is with reluctance therefore that we have had to amend our Tier 2 visa fees for in-country applications to match those for out-of-country applications, so all Tier 2 visas will, with effect from 1 June 2019, be charged at £1150 + VAT.</p>
<p>However, we have also decided to reduce our fee for dependants from £350 + VAT to £250 + VAT, so for a family of three the cost will remain the same as before.</p>
<p>And additionally, as all service options involve the same amount of work for us now, our fee of £1150 + VAT will apply whether clients opt for standard, priority or super priority service.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In recent months Sunico Immigration has strengthened its team of <span class="caps">OISC </span>accredited advisers – Kevin Carlin achieved <span class="caps">OISC</span> accreditation in May 2017 and Garima Arora, who is qualified to the equivalent of <span class="caps">OISC</span>Level 3, joined us in January, so we now have five <span class="caps">OISC</span> advisers on the team.</p>
<p>We have also settled in to our new offices close by Horsham station and this provides us with a larger and lighter environment in which to work.</p>
<p>One reason for these changes has been to enable one of our directors, and senior case worker, Sarah Bryant to significantly reduce her working hours. Garima has successfully taken over most of her workload now, although Sarah will be available to cover any particularly busy periods, sickness or holidays.</p>
<p>Kevin Carlin has been promoted to Client Services Manager and he will now oversee the incoming workload as well as take on responsibility for issuing CoS and sponsor licence admin support. With this last point in mind, and as mentioned in our newsletter last year, we will shortly be adding him as a Level 1 user on all clients’ <span class="caps">SMS</span>. AO’s will receive notification as and when Kevin is added on their <span class="caps">SMS</span>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s all change here at Sunico Immigration this month as we move in to our new offices close to Horsham station and welcome Garima Arora who joins us as a senior caseworker on 2nd January 2018.</p>
<p>Sunico Immigration new address is as follows:</p>
<p>Tower 42<br />
25 Old Broad Street<br />
Horsham<br />
RH13 5SB</p>
<p>Our telephone number remains the same: +44-741-836-4727</p>
<p>Our existing office will also remain open until 31st January 2018 to receive courier/parcel deliveries and post.</p>
<p>Our new office is situated just 150 yards from Horsham station, which has direct and frequent train services to East Croydon (for the <span class="caps">UKVI</span>Public Enquiry Office), Gatwick and London (Victoria and London Bridge).</p>
<p>Garima Arora joins us on 2nd January 2018, having just qualified as a solicitor this month. Garima has been working as a Level 2 <span class="caps">IAAS</span>Caseworker for over two years which is equivalent to <span class="caps">OISC</span> Level 3, so has extensive knowledge and experience working in immigration which will further broaden our scope and client offering.</p>
<p>I am sure you will share with me in welcoming her to Sunico Immigration and no doubt she will be speaking to many of you very soon!</p>
