<h1><strong>The New Immigration System and How it Will Affect You.</strong></h1>
<p>On the 19th of February the government released its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uks-points-based-immigration-system-policy-statement?utm_source=adda7e36-20e4-4894-ac9d-dc892abcae49&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=govuk-notifications&utm_content=immediate">plans for immigration</a> from 2021. Find out what impact this could have on you, your business or your students. It should be noted that EU, EEA and Swiss citizens will all remain non-visa nationals, capable of entering for 6 months without a visa under the normal visitor rules.</p>
<h2><strong>Changes to the skills based system</strong></h2>
<p>Despite the government’s claims to reduce low-skilled migration, they will be lowering both the minimum general salary threshold as well as the minimum necessary RQF skill level. The new rules will apply equally to applicants applying from both inside and outside the EU, although not to EU residents already in the country who have settled or pre-settled status.</p>
<p><strong>The minimum salary</strong> will be lowered to £25,600 from £30,000, with the potential to go down to £20,480 if the applicant has strengths awarding them points in other areas (for example working in a shortage occupation or having a relevant PhD). This appears to lead to an counter-intuitive scenario where the stronger the applicant, the less the sponsoring company is required to pay them. It will be interesting to see how the government reconciles this with their pledge to attract the ‘brightest and best’ and to reduce wage undercutting.</p>
<p><strong>The minimum RQF level</strong> of the job will be lowered from RQF6 to RQF3, essentially meaning that the required difficulty level of the job to be offered has gone from one equivalent in experience and difficulty to a Bachelor’s degree, to one equivalent in experience and difficult to A-levels. While this does not cover unskilled entry positions, it is still a big shift in the required skill level in order to sponsor an overseas worker.</p>
<p><strong>The Resident Labour Market Test</strong> will be abolished along with the cap on the number of people who are able to come to the UK on the skilled-worker route.</p>
<p><strong>The Global Talent Scheme</strong> will be opened to EU, EEA and Swiss citizens, allowing highly-skilled scientists and researchers to come to the UK without a job offer. This will also be expanded to be more accessible to those with a background in STEM subjects, although more details on this are not yet available.</p>
<p><strong>The Seasonal Agricultural Visa</strong> pilot scheme is due to be quadrupled (from 2,500 to 10,000) as the government recognises this sector is reliant on low-skilled temporary workers to function. This would allow farms to hire workers for a period of up to 6 months, and is intended to ease pressure on the agricultural sector during busy harvest months. There is no other current path for unskilled workers to enter the UK, which does little to reassure employers in other sectors heavily reliant on unskilled or low-paid workers, including care-work, hospitality and construction.</p>
<h2><strong>International Students and Graduates</strong></h2>
<p>This appears to be largely similar to its current form however there are a few differences. Most obviously the student routes will now be open to EU, EEA and Swiss citizens.</p>
<p>Secondly and perhaps most excitingly for those hoping to study in the UK and work here afterwards, a new immigration route will be opening in 2021. This will allow graduates who complete their degree from summer 2021 to stay for up to 2 years after the end of their degree to work or look for work. They can work at any RQF skill level during this period but if they wished to convert their visa to a skills-based visa at the end of the 2 years they would presumably need to secure a job offer meeting the minimum salary and RQF levels described above.</p>
<h2><strong>What should I do?</strong></h2>
<p>If you are an EU citizen in the UK, we strongly advise applying for the settled or pre-settled scheme as soon as possible to secure your right to live and work in the UK next year.</p>
<p>If you are an employer or educational institute considering sponsoring overseas workers or students in the future, we would advise applying for your sponsor license now. We can assist with this process, so call us on +44-741-836-4727 or emails us at <a href="../../../../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="066f68606946736d706f75677528656928736d">[email&#160;protected]</a> to arrange a consultation.</p>

<p><strong>&#8220;No Automatic Deportation After Brexit&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>This has been the latest revelation from Boris Johnson regarding the settlement of EU citizens in the UK after Brexit. On the face of it this seems like a very positive message to EU citizens concerned about their future in the UK after Brexit, but let’s examine what it really means for EU migrants and their employers.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Does this mean people who fail to apply for settled status by the deadline will be allowed to stay after all?</strong></p>
<p>In short, unlikely. The government has indicated that in order to avoid deportation after missing the deadline, EU migrants must ‘give grounds for why it was not possible to apply in the timeline, if no valid reason is given then the valid immigration rules will be applied.’ It is not clear exactly what the government would regard as a ‘valid reason’ but it is likely to be a difficult threshold to meet given that applicants have got until 30 June 2021 to apply and they have been able to apply since 30th of March 2019.</p>
<p>This would suggest that an applicant would need to provide evidence of a compelling impediment to application which spanned over 2 years. It is unlikely many people would be able to satisfy this criteria. While the wording of ‘valid immigration rules will be applied’ deliberately avoids the term ‘removal’, it is clear that this may be the fate of those who fail to apply in time.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Can those who have not yet applied for settled status continue to work in the UK now we have left the EU?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. While a survey by the grassroots organisation &#8216;the3million&#8217; indicates that 1 in 10 EU citizens have already been asked to provide evidence of their settled status, this is not a legal requirement. EU citizens may continue to work without applying for settled status throughout the transition period. A lack of clarity in government communications has left employers and employees alike confused as to what their duties are, but until the end of the transition period, EU workers can continue to work, although they should still aim to complete the settlement application at their earliest convenience.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What kind of proof will people receive of their settled status?</strong></p>
<p>Controversially, the government has elected to provide no physical documentation confirming the settled status of EU migrants. All records will be electronic which the government claims will “future-proof [applicants] rights and is linked to their passport or ID card, replacing physical documents which can get lost, stolen, damaged, tampered with and expire”. 90% of survey participants however indicated they feared discrimination without a form of physical evidence which can be shown to employers, banks or landlords, and would prefer a card.</p>
<p>Maike Bohn, co-founder of the3million has warned that the government is setting itself up for another Windrush crisis by failing to provide physical evidence which applicants may be able to later use to prove their right to live in the UK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will have to wait to see the full impact of the EU settled scheme, but as always, anybody concerned about their immigration status should contact us on +44-741-836-4727 or at <a href="../../../../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="61080f070e21140a17081200124f020e4f140a">[email&#160;protected]</a> for a consultation.</p>

<p>The Migration Advisory Committee has released an <a href="../../../../government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/873155/PBS_and_Salary_Thresholds_Report_MAC_word_FINAL.pdf">extensive report</a> on the Points-Based System and Salary Thresholds. This was commissioned by the Government in July and September of last year.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering how the system might affect you, or your employees, then read on for a brief introduction to the new system as imagined by the MAC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What might change?</strong></p>
<p>The 278-page report advises against a full-scale ‘Australian-style’ points-based system. Instead, it recommends retaining the existing Tier 2 structure with an addition of lower skill-level jobs and a lower salary threshold from the current £30,000 per year.</p>
<ul>
<li>Foreign nationals hoping to come to the UK may now be able to do so without a job offer if they score high enough on the points system.</li>
<li>The report recommends the existing tier 2 system remain in place, with a salary threshold, as a route for migrants with a job offer. They do however recommend that this route be expanded to include medium skilled workers.</li>
<li>Potentially the threshold for migrants settling under the tier 2 route may be paused and the requirements for settlement reviewed to increase flexibility. This is due to concerns that required pay progression is too steep for settlement.</li>
<li>There may be greater flexibility in the salary thresholds for those that come to the UK as full-time workers then transition to part time after having a child.</li>
<li>Overhaul the Tier 1 Exceptional Talent route and re-design it is using a points-based system but add safeguards to prevent abuse.</li>
<li>Introduce a separate pilot visa for ‘remote’ parts of the UK, which could include a lower salary threshold exemption.</li>
<li>Review the Shortage Occupation List after the new immigration system is introduced</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Factors like age, education, work experience and English language ability are likely to be taken into account. It is not yet clear how the government will weight each factor.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What about the income threshold?</strong></p>
<p>Until now foreign workers looking to come to the UK to work must have a job offer paying more than £30,000. The Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) however has just recommended that this be dropped to £25,600 in order to boost recruitment of skilled NHS staff and teachers who are unlikely to meet the current threshold.</p>
<p>The current system is a complex mix of occupation specific thresholds relating to average earnings in a specific sector, worker experience, and a general threshold. The MAC indicated this could be profitably improved by having new entrant rates at 70% of the experienced rate, and using national pay scales to calculate thresholds in sectors like education and the NHS.</p>
<p>They also recommend that differences in average pay across regions should not be taken into account, with one threshold for the entirety of the UK, citing concerns that lower thresholds in certain parts of the UK risk ‘institutionalising’ some parts of the UK as ‘lower wage’, as well as adding unnecessary complexity.</p>
<p>While some stakeholders would prefer no threshold aside from the minimum wage, the MAC justifies the continued wage threshold by arguing that it prevents the undercutting of the labour market (i.e. employing migrants because they are cheaper than British nationals), ensures migrants are making net positive contributions and makes sure that policy supports the current government’s “ambition to make the UK a high wage, high skill, high productivity economy&#8221;.</p>
<p>Concerns that sectors such as social care will still fail to meet this lower threshold and may suffer staffing shortages have been dismissed, claiming “the root cause of the problems there is the failure to offer competitive terms and conditions”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will watch with bated breath to see if these recommendations actually result in any material changes in immigration policy. <a href="../../../../new-australian-style-immigration-policy/index.htm">As we have said  before</a>, the introduction of the &#8220;Australian&#8221; points based system was never anything ground-breaking, so it will be interesting to see how the current government works to implement these MAC recommendations.</p>

<p>While one of the current government’s selling points has been its pledge to crack down on immigration and to reduce the overall number of people coming to the UK, it has chosen to review the income threshold of 30K which prospective workers would have to meet in order to enter the UK. Let’s explore what this means in practice:</p>
<p><strong>What’s the current system?</strong></p>
<p>The current system for non-EU workers to come to the UK to work requires applicants to meet several stringent conditions. Applicants must currently meet an income threshold, although this varies based on the vocation, as well as the age and experience of the applicant. Applicants must also demonstrate a good knowledge of English.</p>
<p>Companies hoping to employ migrant workers from outside of the EEA also have to prove that they have not been able to find anyone within the UK or the EEA capable of doing the job unless the job is on the shortage occupation list. There is also a cap on the number of workers who can enter if they are not filling a position in a shortage occupation.</p>
<p><strong>What’s Boris proposing?</strong></p>
<p>Boris wants to replace the current system with a more holistic points-based system under which income would be taken into account alongside English ability, occupation, and qualification.  Each contributing factor would be assigned points, and the point total used to decide on whether the person would be a benefit to the UK.</p>
<p><strong>What will change?</strong></p>
<p>Critics of the current system argue that the income cap severely restricts the ability of industries which employ workers who are skilled but not particularly well-paid to fill positions. This includes the NHS, farm-workers and other industries which currently rely on EU workers to do low paid but skilled or crucial work.</p>
<p>Boris has pledged to cut ‘unskilled’ immigration but has not set out exactly who he will class as an ‘unskilled’ worker. This raises concern over the ability of organisations reliant on EU labour, such as care homes, to recruit enough staff, should their staff not be considered ‘skilled’ workers.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the removal of the wage cap will make the UK more appealing to skilled workers in low-paying industries to contribute to the UK economy, as well as mitigating some of the potential labour shortages as a result of Brexit.</p>

<p>Many of you will be getting a monthly e-mail from the UKVI sponsor team reminding you to request your CoS allocation for next year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This won’t be received by those clients on Auto Renewal (about half of you) whose new CoS allocation for 2020/2021 will show up on the SMS on 6 April automatically – go to sponsor summary and scroll down to Tier 2 (General) and Tier 2 (ICT) CoS and the new number available will be shown – this is usually equal to the number issued last year.  If you didn’t issue any, or may need more this year, then we can always request additional CoS for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those receiving e-mails will not be on automatic renewal, and so we will put in a basic request for you, similar in number to those issued this year, which may well be 0.  If you may need any, or any more, next year, we can always request additional CoS for you.  We need to provide detailed reasons why eg: the vacancy details and/or candidate details, major recruitment drive, etc..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember of course that for all out-of-country allocations we still have to request restricted CoS on a role-by-role basis at the monthly panel.</p>

<p>According to recent reports No 10 is preparing to shut the door on EU migrants two years earlier than expected – so by the end of this year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This move puts the Government on a collision course with business groups such as the CBI who insist that firms will need “at least two years to adapt to any new immigration system”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would recommend that any clients who employ EU migrants currently, or plan to do so this calendar year, check that those staff have applied for and been granted the new “pre-settled” or “settled status”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately UKVI does not issue BRP cards to these people, but they can go to this link: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/view-prove-immigration-status">https://www.gov.uk/view-prove-immigration-status</a>  to verify this. We would recommend that employers ask for a screen-grab or scan of the verification to place on their HR file.</p>

<p>There is actually nothing new about the UK adopting an Australian style points-based system – we have this already.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The UK introduced the PBS (points-based system) in November 2008, with five tiers:  Tier 1 for highly skilled migrants, who were allowed to be self-employed or work for any business; Tier 2 for skilled migrants who had to be sponsored by their employer so needed a Certificate of Sponsorship; Tier 3 for lower managerial and blue collar/agricultural workers (this has never been opened up); Tier 5 for temporary workers and, finally, Tier 4 for students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steadily over the intervening 12 years or so, rules and conditions have been tightened up to the point that now Tier 1 is limited to a few exceptionally talented, or rich, individuals, whilst Tier 2, the arena in which we work together with you, the businesses that power this country, is restricted to highly skilled workers who, apart from a few exceptions, have to earn at least £30,000 p.a and are restricted in numbers from entering the UK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a couple of recent changes which suggest there may be light at the end of the tunnel: nurses and doctors are excluded from the 20,000 annual cap and the list of shortage occupations has been increased significantly so reducing the number of resident labour market tests that need to be carried out and speeding entry for those candidates.</p>
<p>With the publishing of the MAC report today it is good to see that the new “Australian style” PBS Tier 2 (General) is envisaged to apply to both EEA and non-EEA citizens and to be expanded to medium-skill jobs with the cap and Resident Labour Market Test abolished and a simplified process introduced. It is proposed that the minimum salary levels will fall in line with this to £25,600 for experienced workers and £17,920 for new entrants.</p>

<p>As we reach the end of 2019, we approach not only a new year and a new decade, but also a new era for the United Kingdom’s international status. Now that Boris Johnson has firmly established his government’s control, we can expect Brexit negotiations to be finalised soon, with the Prime Minister targeting withdrawal from the EU on January 31st 2020.</p>
<p>What does this mean for the future of the country’s immigration system? As part of their election manifesto, the Conservatives laid out plans for what they claimed were revolutionary changes to the current system, including a new NHS visa and an Australian points-based process. But how much of this was really new, and how much was just electioneering? Let’s take a look at what we know so far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>NHS visa</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During her speech in the House of Commons, which signalled the start of the Parliamentary year, the Queen revealed part of her government’s immigration plans to support the NHS: “A new visa will ensure qualified doctors, nurses and health professionals have fast-track entry to the United Kingdom.”</p>
<p>Boris Johnson went into more detail on these plans back on the campaign trail in November. The changes he mentioned included:</p>
<ul style="float: left;">
<li>The application cost of a visa for medical professionals would be reduced from £928 to £464</li>
<li>A decision on the application would be guaranteed within two weeks</li>
<li>The minimum salary requirement of £30,000 for skilled migrants seeking five-year visas will be scrapped</li>
</ul>
<p>However, dig deeper and these plans start to look less like a radical overhaul of the current system and more like tinkering around the edges.</p>
<p>For one thing, NHS doctors and nurses are already on the shortage occupation list and pay £464 for their visas, so this is misleading information unless Johnson meant it will be a £464 fixed fee for both a three-year and a five-year visa (a five-year visa is currently £928).</p>
<p>For another, visas on standard service are decided within 15 working days, and for an extra £220 overseas applicants will get the decision in five working days. Therefore, the Conservatives’ target of a two-week delivery is only five working days less than the current timeframe, which, as this <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/nov/17/migrants-home-office-super-priority-visa-service-problems">article</a> mentions, isn’t guaranteed as it is.</p>
<p>Therefore, in terms of real change, this really just leaves the scrapping of the £30,000 salary threshold for health professionals applying for a five-year visa.</p>
<p>This is certainly a welcome change. With an ongoing skills shortage continuing to impact the NHS, reducing the threshold will make it easier to recruit nurses and other health professionals on lower wages from outside the UK. And with their stated intention to also remove the cap on the number of migrant health professionals allowed into the country each year, it should help health services to recruit for much-needed positions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Australian points-based system</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“A modern, fair, points-based immigration system will welcome skilled workers from across the world to contribute to the United Kingdom’s economy, communities and public services.”</p>
<p>This statement of intent, also from the Queen’s Speech, is another part of the government’s claims to initiate radical reform of the UK’s immigration system, but, as with those made around the NHS visa, there is little new here to impress the well-informed.</p>
<p>We already have a points-based system for non-EU nationals. This was introduced in 2008 and was itself based on the Australian points-based system but has, over the past decade, become frustrated by complexity and increasingly stringent rules.</p>
<p>As visa and immigration advisors working with UK immigration policy on a daily basis, we’re the first to welcome change if it addresses the difficulties inherent in the current system. The UK needs a points-based model that meets our industry needs. However, while it is early days for this government, so far the changes to the UK immigration system they’ve set out seem to be focused more on satisfying their voter base rather than bringing about the changes necessary for industry.</p>
<p>As ever, we will be keeping a close eye on events and ensuring that we remain up-to-date and compliant with any changes to UK immigration policy. As this article shows, it’s a complicated business fraught with pitfalls, which is why we always recommend soliciting the support of an expert.

<p>International students will be allowed to stay in the UK for two years after graduating, reviving the Tier 1 (Post-study) visa that was shelved by the Home Office back in 2012.  Almost 400,000 Tier 1 PSW visas were granted in each of the five year between 2008 and 2012.</p>
<p>Effective from the 2020/21 university intake, those who enrol on undergraduate, postgraduate or PhD courses in the UK will be able to stay in the country to work or look for work for two years after they graduate.</p>
<p>However, unlike the route which closed in 2012, this new route will also include safeguards to ensure only genuine, credible students are eligible.  Previously the post-study route allowed students to find any job, regardless of the skills required.</p>
<p>This announcement follows the creation of a new fast-track visa route for scientists and the removal of the limit on PHD students moving into the skilled work visa route, which collectively aim to cement the UK as a science superpower and a world-leader in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) sector.</p>
<p>There are over 450,000 foreign students in the UK, generating £20 billion per year through education exports, and research shows that they tend to earn considerably more than their UK counterparts once they leave university.</p>
<p>However, the four months “extra time” currently granted to Tier 4 students forces many to leave the UK as they do not have sufficient time or cannot demand a high enough salary to qualify for a sponsored Tier 2 work visa.</p>
<p>Dependant on the restrictions placed on eligibility, this additional two years should prove extremely popular and help make the UK education system more attractive to overseas students once again.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">According to the Office for National Statistics, the first quarter of 2019 saw the number of EU nationals employed in Britain hit an <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/timeseries/eq4u/lms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all-time high of almost 2.4 million</a>. Despite ongoing uncertainty surrounding Brexit, UK businesses have continued to invest in recruitment, creating 100,000 new jobs in the first three months of the year, and EU nationals have helped them to fill those positions. However, impending changes to immigration rules are almost certain to affect this trend and create challenges for UK recruiters.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the event of a no-deal Brexit, as of October 31st, EU nationals are likely to become subject to the same restrictions other overseas nationalities currently face when seeking employment in Britain. This means UK businesses who wish to continue employing EU workers post-Brexit are likely to need to hold a valid sponsor licence, and ensure sponsored applicants obtain a valid working visa.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The additional complexity of the recruitment process could lead to UK employers experiencing difficulties in filling vacancies. However, one measure that seeks to avoid this situation is the recent update to the Shortage Occupation List (SOL).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The list defines occupations that are especially under-recruited, and therefore subject to exceptions from immigration employment laws. In anticipation of the possible impact Brexit could have for UK recruiters, the government engaged the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) to review the SOL for the first time since 2013. Published in May 2019, the proposed list includes the additions of such diverse occupations as veterinarians, web designers, and secondary school teachers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Employers recruiting for roles on the SOL can benefit from the following advantages:</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>No need to pass the Resident Labour Market Test (RLMT), which shows an attempt has been made to recruit domestically. This makes a saving for employers in terms of vacancy advertising and recruitment time</li>
<li>These jobs are automatically granted a high level of points in the visa system, so a migrant cannot be turned down for sponsorship, even if the annual cap on the Tier 2 scheme has been reached</li>
<li>The job does not need to meet the minimum salary threshold required for settlement after five years</li>
<li>Visa application fees are lower if the occupation is on the SOL, making it more attractive to foreign applicants and their dependants</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you are involved in recruitment and want to find out more about how Brexit and the changes to the SOL may affect the process, the team at Sunico Immigration can help.</p>

<div class="entry-content" id="post-entry-content">
<p><em>What is the EU Settlement scheme, how does it affect EU workers in Britain, and why should employers take notice?</em></p>
<p>The EU Settlement Scheme is a government programme that allows EU, EEA or Swiss nationals currently living in the UK to apply to remain here following the country’s exit from the European Union. Successful applicants who have lived here for five years or more will be given settled status, while those who have been here for under five years will receive pre-settled status.</p>
<p>It’s imperative that those responsible for the recruitment and management of overseas workers in their companies are aware of the scheme and what is required during the application process. While it’s not yet clear what will happen to EU employees in Britain without a registered status, it’s safe to assume they will no longer be able to work in the country once the deadline has passed. Along with causing disruption for both the worker and their employer, there may also be legal ramifications for both parties.</p>
<p><em>What can I do as an employer to keep my EU employees?</em></p>
<p>Firstly, there are a couple of dates for UK employers and their EU employees to be aware of. If Britain and the EU agree a Brexit deal by the 31st October deadline, then the final date for registering for settled status will be 30th June 2021. However, if no deal is reached, the date moves forward to 31st December 2020. The government’s website explains the process here: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/eusettledstatus">https://www.gov.uk/eusettledstatus</a></p>
<p>As an employer, there are a number of steps you can take to prepare</p>
<p>1. Undertake an audit to identify which of your employees are affected<br>
2. Make use of the factsheets, posters and videos that the government has provided to raise awareness in your workforce<br>
3. Check the expiry date of your Tier 2 sponsor licence. This system is likely to be extended to EU nationals after 2020<br>
4. Make a diary note to conduct Right to Work checks in 2020 in order for your business to remain compliant with new immigration rules<br>
5. Encourage your employees to review the options open to them. For instance, if they are eligible for Permanent Residence it might be more appropriate to apply for that instead of the EU Settlement Scheme</p>
<p>If you’re concerned about the possible pitfalls of the process, the Sunico Immigration immigration team offers expert assistance. Let us help you by:</p>
<p>• Reviewing the status of your EU employees and their family members<br>
• Assisting with applications<br>
• Advising employees of their options<br>
• Performing compliance reviews<br>
• Examining your Right to Work checks and providing advice on best practice post-Brexit</p>

<p>HR managers, is your company Brexit-ready?</p>
<p>As Britain prepares to leave the European Union, it’s
important for UK companies employing EU workers to ensure they’re ready for the
changes that will follow. Those responsible for recruitment should be aware of
these changes and understand what they mean for both the company’s current EU
employees and its future recruitment strategy.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Some steps that can be taken to ensure a smooth transition
for businesses and their employees include:</p>
<p><strong>Keeping your current
EU workers</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, it’s important to ensure that any EU, EEA or Swiss
nationals currently employed by your company can continue to stay in the UK
after 30th June 2021 (if a deal is not agreed, the deadline will be 31st
December 2020). The government’s EU Settlement Scheme gives these people the
opportunity to apply to continue living in the UK following its exit from the
European Union. Applicants who have been here for five years or more will
receive ‘settled’ status, while those who have lived here for less than five
years will get ‘pre-settled’ status.</p>
<p>The process is free, and the government has provided a step-by-step set of instructions on its website to guide applicants. HR officers should familiarise themselves with the process so that they can advise and support any of their company’s employees who need to apply. You can visit the site <strong><a href="https://www.gov.uk/eusettledstatus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="here (opens in a new tab)">here</a></strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Preparing to recruit
from outside the EU</strong></p>
<p>Once Brexit has taken place, the process of hiring workers
from the EU will become more difficult. As a result, companies may choose to
start recruiting people from further afield, although they will need to prepare
for this shift in focus.</p>
<p>According to a recent survey, 76% of businesses have no
contingency funds for future recruitment outside the EU. The cost, in terms of
both money and time, of sponsorship licences and Tier 2 Visas means companies
must determine whether they can afford to hire from abroad, as well as identify
the resources necessary to carry out their recruitment plans.</p>
<p><strong>What is a Tier 2 (General)
Visa and why do workers need them?</strong></p>
<p>Tier 2 (General) Visas are the most common type of visa.
They apply to skilled workers earning £30,000 a year and upwards, and require
sponsorship from the company offering employment. Proof of sponsorship comes in
the form of a certificate of sponsorship (CoS).</p>
<p>Once Britain has left the EU, EU citizens without settled or
pre-settled UK status may be subject to the same rules that apply to people
from the rest of the world, meaning they will need to apply for a Tier 2 Visa
if they intend to work in the UK.</p>
<p><strong>How much does an
overseas Tier 2 Visa application cost for a single applicant on a 3-year
contract?</strong></p>
<ul><li>Application fee &#8211; £610 </li><li>Immigration health charge &#8211; £1,200</li><li>Immigration skills charge (per year of contract)
£1,092 to £3,000 (depending on whether your company is categorised as large or
small)</li><li>Certificate of Sponsorship £199 </li><li>Priority visa service £220</li></ul>
<p>Due to the cost, complexity, and
potential pitfalls of the visa application process, recruiters would be wise to
work with an expert in the field. At Sunico Immigration, our team guides companies
through the hurdles of bringing staff into the UK, and facilitates the movement
of employees globally.</p>

eligibility quickly and to spot issues before they develop into problems,

<p>Sponsors that are not on automatic annual renewal will receive monthly e-mails asking them to submit their requests for a CoS allocation.</p>
<p>Annual CoS allocations are for unrestricted CoS only, so can only be issued to people already in the UK, i.e current employees requiring an extension to their visas or new recruits, who are either graduates switching from Tier 4 student visas or those already working for another sponsor on a <a href="https://sunicoimmigration.com/visa_services/working-visas/">Tier 2 General visa</a>.</p>
<p>Sunico Immigration will go through every client’s list of sponsored workers over the next few weeks and request CoS for any whose visas expire between April 2019 and April 2020.</p>
<p>Please note too that you can still ask for additional CoS after 6 April. We just need the name, nationality and DoB of each applicant and, if they are new recruits, full details of the role, salary and resident test details if relevant.</p>
<p>For those clients on Auto Renewal, we have to wait until 6 April and see what you have been allocated and then, if necessary, request extra CoS for you.</p>

<p>Brexit will no doubt have a great impact on the business immigration sector.</p>
<p>The Migration Advisory Committee (MAC)’s long-awaited report on the effect of European migration to the UK has been published last month.</p>
<p>According to reports, the MAC does not see ‘compelling reasons’ to give EU citizens any preferential treatment over non-EU citizens. Recommendations are made largely to loosen the Tier 2 system itself and have a more open policy like in countries such as Canada.</p>
<p><strong>Below is a summary of the key recommendations for work migration post-Brexit</strong></p>
<p>1. Making it easier for higher-skilled workers to migrate to the UK than lower-skilled workers.</p>
<p>2. No preference for EU citizens</p>
<p>3. Abolish the cap on the number of migrants under Tier 2 (General).</p>
<p>4. Tier 2 (General) to be open to all jobs at RQF3 and above.</p>
<p>5. Maintain existing salary thresholds for all migrants in Tier 2.</p>
<p>6. Retain but review the Immigration Skills Charge.</p>
<p>7. Consider abolition of the Resident Labour Market Test. If not abolished, extend the numbers of migrants who are exempt through lowering the salary required for exemption.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if all foreign migrants are bought into the same system then employers will need to become extra vigilant as risk of civil penalties faced by employers will increase significantly.</p>
<p>Hiring costs will increase and if medium skilled jobs are also included as more businesses will require to get on the sponsor licence register meaning increased administrative burden on organisations and a significant effect on businesses which have previously not had any engagement with the wonderful immigration system.</p>

<p>Tier 2 Migrants will no longer require to have been continuously employed throughout the 5-year qualifying period to be eligible for settlement.</p>
<p>Previously, the rules stated only breaks of employment less than 60 days could be disregarded.</p>
<p>However, since the Home Office is notoriously slow in issuing curtailment notifications, this may lead to some Tier 2 holders gaining additional time to change employment within the UK whilst still qualifying for indefinite leave to remain.</p>
<p>This will definitely bring a sigh of relief to many.</p>

<p>Another subtle but big change introduced has been how continuous residence will be counted over the 5 years period when applying for Indefinite leave to remain (‘ILR’).</p>
<p>Before the changes, the 180-day absences were calculated in fixed blocks. However, absences are now to be counted on a rolling basis thus an application for <span class="caps">ILR</span> could be refused if at any point over the five years the 180-day limit is exceeded in any 12-month period.</p>
<p>Paragraph 245AAA(a) now states:</p>
<p>“(a) References to a “continuous period” “lawfully in the UK” means, subject to paragraph (e), residence in the UK for an unbroken period with valid leave, and for these purposes a period shall be considered unbroken where:</p>
<p>(i) the applicant has not been absent from the UK for more than 180 days during any 12-month period in the continuous period, except that any absence from the UK for the purpose of assisting with a national or international humanitarian or environmental crisis overseas shall not count towards the 180 days, if the applicant provides evidence that this was the purpose of the absence(s) and that their Sponsor, if there was one, agreed to the absence(s) for that purpose;”.</p>
<p>One is going to need more than just a simple table on Excel to tackle this change!</p>

<p>11th January 2018, saw many changes introduced to the Immigration Rules.</p>
<p>A change which will have huge impact on future applications for entry clearance, as well as extension applications by those who are already in the UK and need to extend their leave after 11 January 2018 is that the <span class="caps">PBS</span> dependant cannot be absent from the UK for more than 180 days during any 12-month continuous period.</p>
<p>The following has been inserted into paragraph 319E of the Immigration Rules in relation to <span class="caps">PBS</span> dependants:</p>
<p>(d) not have been absent from the UK for more than 180 days during any 12-month period in the continuous period, except that:</p>
<p>(1) any absence from the UK for the purpose of assisting with a national or international humanitarian or environmental crisis overseas shall not count towards the 180 days, if the applicant provides evidence that this was the purpose of the absence(s), and</p>
<p>(2) any absence from the UK during periods of leave granted under the Rules in place before 11 January 2018 shall not count towards the 180 days.</p>
<p>The amendment will not impact residence for those who have already extended and can obtain <span class="caps">ILR</span> without extending again, and will not change things immediately for those who have already been granted entry clearance until they come to extend.</p>

<p><strong>Being a sponsor – A privilege that bites. High Court confirms companies to be held at strict compliance under Tier 2</strong></p>
<p>In the recent case of R (Sri Prathinik Consulting Limited) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] <span class="caps">EWHC</span> 3204 (Admin), the Hight Court dismissed a company Judicial Review against revocation of licence reinforcing the principle that sponsor licences are a privilege, not be taken lightly.</p>
<p>The case involved a IT company that had failed to keep the required evidence relating to <span class="caps">RMLT</span> as specified and assigned the <span class="caps">COS</span> 6 months after the <span class="caps">RMLT</span> was concluded.</p>
<p>The Court stated that “[s]ponsors have advantages and cannot complain if they are required to comply with relevant Guidance”</p>
<p>It is all too easy to lose track of the mind field of duties one needs to adhere to. In the view of the above, it has become as important as ever to make sure you as a company are fulfilling these duties. In the view of the Home Office and High Court, you as a sponsor has opted into taking on this level of responsibility so should be held accountable. There will be no sympathy.</p>
<p>There are been some changes in the Tier 2 sponsor guidance from 11th January 2018, a summary of few listed below:</p>
<p>• B-rated sponsors can no longer add branches to their licences or if you are downgraded to a B- rated sponsor.<br>
• Those directly employed by sponsors can no longer certify copies of documents.<br>
• It is now a specific sponsor duty to report if the size of the business changes from small to large or vice versa.<br>
• It is recommended that licences are renewed early, or at least one month before the expiry date. If applied in good time, there will chance to apply again if application is rejected. If licence has expired when decision to reject or refuse your application is made, there will not be a chance to make another application to renew a licence.<br>
• The start date given on the CoS must be the date that the migrant is expected to start working for you at the time the CoS is assigned. If such start date for a Tier 2 (General) migrant is subsequently changed after leave has been granted, it must be within 28 days from the later of:<br>
• the date on which their entry clearance or leave to remain is granted<br>
• the start date on their CoS (taking into account any changes to start date properly reported before leave is granted)</p>
<p>• If a sponsor fails to provide any documents within a specified timeframe, action will be taken</p>

<h4>12 - 05 - 18</h4>

<div class="entry-content" id="post-entry-content">
<p>We have noticed recently that the <span class="caps">UKVI</span> are becoming increasingly vigilant and demanding when assessing resident tests.</p>
<p>Sunico Immigration manage in excess of 100 resident labour market tests each year, both for changes of employment and out-of-country recruits. As part of these tests we have to provide reasons why any <span class="caps">EEA</span> applicants are not suitable for the role and clients need to keep records of these tests on file in readiness for a sponsor licence compliance visit.</p>
<p>Whilst Tier 2 guidance states sponsors should keep copies of CVs for any shortlisted applicants (along with interview notes etc) compliance officers are now demanding to see every CV, regardless of whether the candidate was shortlisted. We hold these in file here for every test conducted, so if required we can provide these to you, but in future we may decide to forward every applicant to clients on conclusion of every test – apologies for yet more filing!</p>
<p>We have also noticed for the first time that, when Tier 2 limits request additional information about restricted CoS requests, they are now asking to see every single application received as part of their consideration process.</p>
<p>In future, when running these tests, we may therefore have to ask clients to look at a few more cv’s than previously to help us check suitability prior to reaching out for further information from the applicants themselves.</p>
<p><span class="caps">UKVI</span> have also slowed down their consideration process for restricted CoS in the last month or so. Whereas 80% of requests used to be allocated on the day the panel met (usually 11th of each month) we are now having to wait up to 10 days for the allocations to be approved. This December for example, the first one (of eight requests) was allocated two days late, on 13th, whilst we are still waiting at the time of writing for all the others. And no reasons are provided for the delay, and there is no way to expedite the requests so we just have to wait.</p>

<p>A number of small changes to Tier 2 will be introduced in the Autumn as part of the UKVI’s response to the <span class="caps">MAC</span> Report late last year.</p>
<p>Here is a brief summary of the main points likely to affect our clients:</p>
<p>• The minimum salary threshold for Tier 2 (General) “experienced workers” goes up to £25,000 in October and to £30,000 p.a. next April 2017. In reality most <span class="caps">NQF</span> Level 6 roles have a minimum salary requirement above £30k anyway.<br>
• The threshold for Tier 2 (<span class="caps">ICT</span>) short-term goes up from £24,800 p.a. to £30,000 p.a. prior to the sub-category being closed in April 2017.<br>
• The threshold for Tier 2 (<span class="caps">ICT</span>) Graduate Trainee goes down from £24,800 p.a. to £23,000 p.a.<br>
• The Tier 2 (<span class="caps">ICT</span>) Skills transfer sub-category will be closed.<br>
• Tier 2 (<span class="caps">ICT</span>) applicants will become liable for the Immigration Health Surcharge</p>
