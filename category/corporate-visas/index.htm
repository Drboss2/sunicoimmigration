<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the 24<sup>th</sup> of May 2021 Priti Patel announced a variety of changes to be made in the immigration. The gist of the move is increased digitisation of the border and more accurate tracking of people who enter and exit the UK, there will also be some changes to existing immigration routes, although these do not seem to be on the same level as the government’s total overhaul of the system last year. A summary of the main changes is as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Electronic Travel Authorisation</strong></p>
<p>The government plans to bring in an electronic pre-clearance system for travellers to the UK, whether they are visa nationals or not. Currently nationals of a number of countries (for example countries in the EEA and the USA) are able to travel to the UK without seeking any kind of prior permission to enter. Under the new system, everyone would need to apply for some form of clearance, whether in the form of a full visa, or in the form of an ETA.</p>
<p>The ETAs will reportedly cost £9, a 6 month visit visa currently costs £95 for comparison, but this is yet to be confirmed. This is not a new idea, and it is not likely to be rolled out in the immediate future.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Increased Digitisation</strong></p>
<p>The government is keen to increase digitisation of the systems which verify foreign national’s right to work and live in the UK. Currently most foreign nationals are issued with a biometric residence permit, a physical document they can use to demonstrate their status to employers and landlords. EEA residents with settled or pre-settled status, and some migrants from the EU who applied using the government’s app, are now not issued with any physical document and all checks must be carried out online. The government is looking to expand this system.</p>
<p>It is the long term plan that eventually the majority of biometric information will be given digitally, and that the current entry clearance vignette system will be replaced with E-visas. In the immediate future the Home Office has made the commitment that all border control staff will be able to check if an individual has settled or pre-settled status. This will hopefully reduce the number of issues arising at the border where EEA individuals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Points Based System</strong></p>
<p>The ink is barely dry on the government’s new points based system, but the government is already looking to tweak aspects of the business visas. We are still awaiting details on what exactly this might look like, but the government promises to ‘continue to simplify our Immigration Rules and make them as user-friendly and accessible as possible’ which can only be a good thing.</p>
<p>There are also plans for “Global Business Mobility” visa which is likely to combine several existing routes, including intra-company transfer, representative of an overseas business.</p>
<p>The unsponsored work route for high achievers has also been confirmed, and the current plan is for this to open in early 2022.</p>

<p>Readers should note these costs are likely to change in 2021 when the government launches its new points based system. At the time of writing (17/08/2020) the Immigration Health Surcharge is £400 per year, but this will be raised to £624 per year from 01/10/2024.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>What are the Costs?</strong></h3>
<p>Companies MUST pay the following to sponsor a Tier 2 worker</p>
<ul>
<li>Immigration Skills Charge (unless the individual is switching from a Tier 4 (student) visa to a Tier 2 visa, will do a job with a PhD level standard occupational classification, or has a Tier 2 (ICT) Graduate Trainee visa).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For small, or charitable sponsors this costs £364 for the first 12 months and then £182 for each 6 month period after that. For medium or large sponsors it will cost £1000 for the first 12 months and £500 for each additional 6 month period. This will be refunded if the worker’s visa is refused or they do not start working with you. You will get a partial refund if they leave their job before the end date on the CoS.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sponsor Licence fee (if not already licensed) £536 for a small or charitable sponsor, £1476 if a medium or large sponsor. (small is defined as £10.2 million or less annual turnover and 50 employees or fewer). This is for 4 years, after which it will need to be renewed.</li>
<li>Issuing a Certificate of Sponsorship. This will cost £199 regardless of the size of the company.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong>In addition to the above the following is also payable for a Tier 2 visa.</p>
<ul>
<li>Immigration Health Surcharge &#8211; £400 a year (going up to £624) 01/10/2020</li>
<li>Application fee outside the UK – Shortage (3 years or less): £464. Non-shortage (3 years or less) £610. Inside the UK (extending or switching). Shortage (3 years or less): £464. Non-shortage (3 years or less) £704.</li>
<li>Biometric enrolment fee &#8211; £19.20</li>
<li>UKVCAS appointment fee &#8211; £0-£210 (depends on location and time)</li>
<li>Expedited processing (optional) – decision in 5 working days = £500, 24 hours = £80</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Who Pays What?</strong></h3>
<p>The Immigration Skills Charge must be paid by the employer, but other costs can be split between employer and applicant. You might for instance decide that you are happy to pay for the application fee but ask the employee to pay for their own Immigration Health Surcharge. This is a matter to work out with your employee prior to applying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>What About Family Members?</strong></h3>
<p>Family members must also pay their own application fees and Immigration Health Surcharges, meaning these costs increase significantly for every additional applicant. You should ask how many family members your potential employee hopes to bring with them and reach an agreement on who will be responsible for the costs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Case Study: Single Worker </strong></h3>
<p>Holly runs a small veterinary practice and is hoping to employ a new veterinary surgeon. One of her employees mentions she has a friend from university, Marcia, who is a Brazilian national and performed top of the class. Holly interviews Marcia and she is perfect for the role so Holly decides to sponsor her for 3 years. Marcia has no partner or children.</p>
<p>Veterinary Surgeon’s are considered a shortage occupation, and Holly’s business is a small family business. As such the cost will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sponsor License £536</li>
<li>Certificate of Sponsorship &#8211; £199</li>
<li>Immigration Skills Charge &#8211; £1092</li>
<li>Immigration Health Surcharge &#8211; £1200</li>
<li>Application Fee (shortage) £464</li>
</ul>
<p>This totals £4027, which seems like a formidable amount for a small company, but is very much towards the lower end of the scale. As you can see with our next case study, once you start adding dependants or considering bigger companies, costs can quickly spiral.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Case Study: Family of 5</strong></h3>
<p>Garima runs a large company with branches all over the world which manufactures luxury cars. She wants to employ Jin, a Chinese national, as a project co-ordinator as he has been introduced to her by an employee of one of the company’s overseas branches. Jin accepts the job offer on the condition that his wife and 3 children are able to travel with him. Garima offers to sponsor him for 3 years.</p>
<p>Project Co-ordinator is not considered a shortage application and Garima’s company is a large multinational outfit so she will have to pay the higher fee for the sponsor license.</p>
<p>The costs will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sponsor License £1476</li>
<li>Certificate of Sponsorship &#8211; £199</li>
<li>Immigration Skills Charge (Large company) &#8211; £3000</li>
<li>Immigration Health Surcharge x 5 &#8211; £6000</li>
<li>Application Fee x 5 &#8211; £3,050</li>
</ul>
<p>This totals £13,725 even without accounting for any additional fees relating to courier service, priority service, or even fees related with using an immigration firm. This is an amount which many employers will balk at being asked to pay. It is important to discuss with the potential employee exactly how much of the cost each party will take responsibility for paying (for instant perhaps the applicant pays the Immigration Health Surcharge, or all costs associated with their dependants). It might also be useful to work out some sort of repayment scheme with employees that don’t have the necessary savings at the time of application. This is particularly relevant where the potential employee is from a country with an unfavourable exchange rate and/or comparatively low earnings which may have made it hard for them to accrue the necessary savings.</p>

<h4>The Sole Representative visa allows overseas businesses to establish a presence for the company in the UK. Under this route, a senior representative from the company can seek to enter the UK to set up a branch or wholly-owned subsidiary of the business in the UK.</h4>
<h4>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/statement-of-changes-to-the-immigration-rules-cp-232-14-may-2020">Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules</a> released by the Home Office last week included tightening of the rules surrounding the Representatives of Overseas Businesses visa category, otherwise known as the ‘Sole Representative visa’.</h4>
<h4>Some of the main changes are as follows:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tighter restrictions for business stakeholders –</strong> Previously, a majority shareholder (51% shareholding or more) could not apply under this route. The rules will now prevent people using this route when they have a majority stake in, or otherwise own or control the overseas business.</li>
<li><strong>Changes to dependent applications </strong> –the partner cannot<i> “have a majority stake in, or otherwise own or control, that overseas business, whether that ownership or control is by means of a shareholding, partnership agreement, sole proprietorship or any other arrangement”. </i>Cumulatively, it appears that the partner and representative can together have a majority or more than a majority, but neither can individually. This means a sole representative could not transfer ownership/control or shares to their partner accompanying them to the UK to meet the requirement.</li>
<li><strong>Genuine intention –</strong> The new wording states that the business’s branch or subsidiary shouldn’t be established solely to facilitate entry.</li>
<li><strong>Skills and experience –</strong> Applicants must now be able to prove they have the necessary skills, experience, knowledge and authority to represent the overseas business in the UK.</li>
</ul>
<h4>For future applications, these changes mean increased scrutiny and more stringent evidence requirements to prove applicants are not using this route as a personal means of gaining entry to the UK.</h4>
<h4>These changes take effect from 4<sup>th</sup> June 2020 and will present many challenges.</h4>
<h4>If your business is looking to expand in the UK,  legal expertise may be even more beneficial than before with the UK tightening the rules around this route.</h4>

<p>On 11 May 2020, the government published its COVID-19 recovery <a href="../../government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/884760/Our_plan_to_rebuild_The_UK_Government_s_COVID-19_recovery_strategy.pdf">strategy.</a>  The UK border will in due course introduce a range of new measures and restrictions.</p>
<p>All international arrivals (unless exempt) will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Able to access increased information at the border about the UK’s social distancing regime</li>
<li>Strongly advised to download and use the NHS tracking app.</li>
<li>Required to supply contact and accommodation information</li>
<li>Required to self-isolate in accommodation for 14 days from the day of arrival in the UK. If the individual(s) cannot demonstrate where they shall be self-isolating, suitable accommodation will be arranged by the government.</li>
</ul>
<p>All journeys within the Common Travel Area (i.e. all journeys between the UK, Crown Dependencies and Ireland) shall be exempt from these measures. Additional exemptions are to be confirmed in an official list which should be published shortly.</p>
<p>Those coming on long terms visas such as Tier 2 are generally asked on the application form regarding their accommodation in the UK. Till date, it has been fine to not specify an address and state that accommodation will be sought upon arrival. However, we now encourage all those coming to the UK to arrange temporary accommodation to avoid any issues at the UK border.</p>
<p>If you have any UK immigration queries regarding your existing visa or these new measures or COVID-19, please contact our team on +44-741-836-4727 or via email on office@sunicoimmigration.com</a></p>

<p>Many of those who applied for a visa outside the UK and were granted their 30 day vignette to enter, but were unable to travel due to the virus, had been left in a limbo of what to do. There was an increasing worry amongst people having to incur extra costs to apply for a replacement.</p>
<p>The UKVI have updated their guidance today and have given much needed guidance on this issue:</p>
<h4 id="if-your-30-day-visa-to-work-study-or-join-family-has-expired">If your 30 day visa to work, study or join family has expired</h4>
<h4>If your 30 day visa to travel to the UK for work, study or to join family has expired, or is about to expire, you can request a replacement visa with revised validity dates free of charge until the end of this year.</h4>
<h4>To make a request, contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-for-uk-visa-applicants-and-temporary-uk-residents?utm_source=1b9655f9-d25e-405b-b691-29aa736d7a48&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=govuk-notifications&utm_content=immediate#helpline">Coronavirus Immigration Help Centre</a>. You’ll need to include your name, nationality, date of birth and your GWF reference number with ‘REPLACEMENT 30 DAY VISA’ in the subject line. If you’ve already contacted us about this, please let us know in your email.</h4>
<h4>You’ll be contacted when our VAC&#8217;s reopen to arrange for a replacement visa to be endorsed in your passport.</h4>
<h4>You will not be penalised for being unable to collect your BRP while coronavirus measures are in place.</h4>
<h4>This process will be in place until the end of 2020.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are pleased that UKVI have taken positive steps to help those stuck overseas and that the process is free of charge. Now the question remains as to when the VAC&#8217;s open and how much backlog there will be.</p>

<p>Pre lockdown, many Tier 2 employees may have been in the process of changing employment. Due to the lockdown, many have been unable to progress their application. This undoubtedly would be causing many anxiety and fear over their visa status.</p>
<p>The UKVI has now updated their COVID 19 <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-for-uk-visa-applicants-and-temporary-uk-residents">guidance</a> to state the following:</p>
<p>If you’re sponsoring an employee who’s waiting for their Tier 2 or 5 visa application to be decided Sponsors may allow employees to start work before their visa application has been decided if:</p>
<ul>
<li>sponsors have assigned them a CoS</li>
<li>the employee submitted their visa application before their current visa expired</li>
<li>the role they are employed in is the same as the one on their CoS</li>
</ul>
<p>The sponsors reporting responsibilities will start from the date of employment, not from the date that their application is granted. If the employee’s application is eventually refused sponsors must terminate their employment.</p>
<p>This will be of some relief to those who were expecting to start new employment. Employment with the new sponsor on the agreed start date, as long as the above conditions are satisfied. Please note that biometrics do not have to have been enrolled.</p>

<p><strong>Applicants who have successfully applied for a UK visa from overseas but are now unable to travel to the UK.</strong></p>
<p>This is perhaps the most pressing concern for a lot of overseas applicants. Once being granted a visa, an applicant must enter the UK before their entry clearance vignette expires. While this can be extended, it can only be extended for a further month, and the process is not free. There is no guarantee that travel conditions will be any better in a month which could result in wasted money, and besides, PBS applicants may also be tied to the work start date on their CoS.</p>
<p>The Home Office needs to allow extension of work start dates for overseas applicants until the end of the year as well as make allowances for applicants to enter the UK using entry vignettes which have expired but were acquired during the COVID-19 crisis. Vignettes issued until the end of the COVID-19 crisis could benefit from being granted for a longer period to allow entry into the UK where possible. The current uncertainty for overseas applicants and sponsoring companies, both who have made significant financial investments into the visa, is not sustainable and we hope will be addressed in future updates.</p>
<p>We advise any individuals stranded overseas to take a printout/screenshot of the FCO travel guidance for the country to have as proof when it is time to apply for ILR or BC applications.</p>
<p><strong>Visa-holders who are unable to collect their BRPs from post-offices or register with the police due to self-isolation.</strong></p>
<p>Currently, individuals have a 10 day from arrival or before the expiry of the temporary vignette in which to collect their BRP from the post-office after arriving in the UK. With many people coming into the UK required to self-isolate for 14 days after arrival, it is not possible for them to obey government guidelines on social-distancing as well as collect their BRP within 10 days.</p>
<p>This problem could be overcome by either extending the window in which individuals must collect the BRP or allowing another individual to collect the BRP on the visa holder&#8217;s behalf, for example, their legal representative. Similar extensions could be applied to registering with the police which must normally be done within 7 days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Visa-holders who are stranded overseas for a period which may invalidate their application for ILR or British Citizenship</strong></p>
<p>Current eligibility requirements for ILR or British Citizenship specify the applicant has not spent more than a certain period (ordinarily 6 months out of every year) out of the UK. This could present problems for those stranded abroad who have exceeded this six-month limit. This is particularly relevant for those hoping to apply for ILR after 5 years on Tier 2 (General) visa, who are unable to renew their tier 2 visa beyond 6 years to clear the period of lengthy absence from their record.</p>
<p>The Home Office should recognise the COVID-19 crisis as an exceptional circumstance and absences from the UK relating to the crisis should not count against an applicant where they can evidence that they were not able to return to the UK due to circumstances beyond their control.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Applicants who require IELTS or Life in the UK to make their application</strong></p>
<p>For some individuals, the next step in their visa process comes with added academic requirements. Applicants for spouse visa extensions are required to show their English has improved and must sit A2 if they previously relied on A1 for their first visa. Applicants hoping to achieve ILR must pass the Life in the UK test. As test centres for both these tests are now closed, those whose visas are running out are left wondering whether they should submit their application without these qualifications, which would ordinarily render it unsuccessful, or risk overstaying until the centres re-enter.</p>
<p>The Home Office should clarify whether applicants applying in-country for an extension may also be able to extend their visas until 31/05/2020 to sit their tests, or whether applications will still be considered valid without sitting the tests given the exceptional circumstances</p>
<p>If you have any Coronavirus related issues with your visa, or any issues you feel have not been addressed by the Home Office, please get in touch at <a href="../../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#30595e565f70455b46594351431e535f1e455b"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="731a1d151c330618051a0012005d101c5d0618">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> or on +44-741-836-4727 for a consultation.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">The UKVI has updated its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-immigration-system-what-you-need-to-know?utm_source=76048cea-190a-4cfd-9041-422016fbfe97&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=govuk-notifications&utm_content=immediate">guidance</a> on the Immigration system coming into place in 2021.</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">The key points to note are:</h4>
<ol>
<li>New immigration routes will open from autumn 2020 for applications to work, live and study in the UK from 1 January 2021.</li>
<li>Re-iteration on the process for Skilled Workers. Please see our <a href="../../the-new-immigration-system-and-how-it-will-affect-you/index.htm">blog on this</a></li>
<li>The global talent scheme will be opened up to EU, EEA and Swiss citizens. It will allow highly-skilled scientists and researchers to come to the UK without a job offer.</li>
<li>Student visa routes will be opened up to EU, EEA and Swiss citizens.</li>
<li>A new graduate immigration route will be available to international students who have completed a degree in the UK from summer 2021. You’ll be able to work or look for work, in the UK at any skill level for up to 2 years.</li>
<li>Short-term work visas in specific sectors (the current ‘Tier 5’) and investor, business development and talent visas (the current ‘Tier 1’) will be opened up to EU citizens.</li>
<li>EU, EEA and Swiss citizens and other non-visa nationals will not require a visa to enter the UK when visiting the UK for up to 6 months.</li>
<li>If you’re an EU, EEA or Swiss citizen living in the UK before 31 December 2020, you and your family can apply to the EU Settlement Scheme to continue living in the UK after 30 June 2021.</li>
<li>EU, EEA and Swiss citizens will use an online service to view their immigration status and to prove their status to others.</li>
<li>Non-EU citizens will continue to use a physical document to prove their immigration status.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the midst of the global pandemic, when the whole nation has seen how much a country relies on its ‘low-skilled’ workers, the Home Office felt it necessary to state that care workers, nurses, hospital porters, cleaners, logistics personnel, postal workers etc will not be able to apply for the UK work visa from January 2021.</p>
<p>The update to the guidance on the new immigration system reiterates:</p>
<p><strong>“There will not be an immigration route specifically for those who do not meet the skills or salary threshold for the skilled worker route.”</strong></p>
<p>The only “low-skilled” workers that the government envisages letting in are agricultural labourers.</p>

<p>Every employer has a duty to ensure that all its employees have the right to work in the UK, either by virtue of their British Citizenship, or as a term of their right to remain. It is a criminal offence to knowingly employ someone who has no right to work in the UK, so it is important that checks are carried out in line with government guidelines. This would normally involve meeting the employee and checking their original documents, however in light of the logistical difficulties involved in this arising from the Covid-19 crisis <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-right-to-work-checks?utm_source=5f32175f-2485-4217-aabb-c7bce637cda7&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=govuk-notifications&utm_content=immediate">the Home Office has made some adjustments</a> to make carrying out these checks easier. In order to carry out checks safely during the Covid-19 crisis the following adjustments have been made:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can ask the worker to submit scanned copies of their original documents by email instead of checking in person.</li>
<li>You can arrange a video chat over Skype, Zoom or a similar app in which the worker can hold their documents up to the camera for you to check.</li>
<li>If the worker has a BRP, Biometric Residence Card or status under the EU settlement scheme you can use the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/view-right-to-work">online right to work checking service</a> while doing a video call with the applicant. The applicant will need to give their permission for you to view their details.</li>
<li>You should record the date you carried out one of the above checks and mark it as ‘adjusted check undertaken on [insert date] due to Covid-19.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If the worker cannot show their documents </strong>you must contact the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/employee-immigration-employment-status">Home Office Employer Checking Service</a> which will provide you with a ‘Positive Verification Notice’, giving you a 6 month statutory excuse if the person is found to have the right to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>When the Covid-19 measures end</strong> you will have to follow the checking process set out in the government’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/right-to-work-checks-employers-guide">right to work checks: an employer’s guide</a>. You will have to perform retrospective checks on employees who started working for you or required a follow-up check during these measures unless you did the check in the manner prescribed in the employers guide with no adjustments. This check must be performed within 8 weeks of the Covid-19 measures ending. If you find during a retrospective check that your employee does not have the right to work you must then end their employment.</p>

<p>Many employers and employees were left in the dark over the impact of furlough and Employer Retention Scheme and how it applies to Tier 2 works as the immigration status of Tier 2 workers is tied to employment at a minimum salary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Friday, the UKVI finally confirmed the below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>As a business, if you are unable to pay the salaries of your sponsored employees because as a company you have temporarily reduced or ceased trading, then you can temporarily reduce the pay of your sponsored employees to 80% of their salary or £2,500 per month, whichever is lower.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The reduction in salary will only be justified if it is a part of a company-wide policy to avoid redundancies and to enable the equal treatment of all workers.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The reductions must be temporary and therefore the salary level must return to at least previous levels once these arrangements come to an end.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems that the UKVI are indicating that the salary can fall below the relevant SOC code salary threshold minimum while the Tier 2 worker is furloughed, without this negatively impacting the sponsorship as long as the salary level returns to at least the previous level once the arrangement comes to an end. This will be comforting news for many employers and employees in this uncertain time.</p>
<p>The UKVI guidance is mute on the point of whether the salary changes need to be reported.  Our expert advice is that all sponsors continue to report this via the SMS and provide an explanation for the change in salary and also report once the salary returns to its normal level. All changes are to reported within 10 working days. Further to this, they should retain evidence of their firm-wide policy on the same as justification. This will also safeguard the sponsor’s position in the event of a UKVI audit in the future.</p>

<p>The short answer is yes. At present there are a number of visa applications which must ordinarily be made from the applicant&#8217;s home country, regardless of whether the applicant has existing leave in the UK. Given the current climate many people are likely to find this difficult to impossible, due to the widespread travel disruption and amount of countries on lockdown.</p>
<p>Thankfully <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-for-uk-visa-applicants-and-temporary-uk-residents">the Home Office has indicated</a> that due to these ‘unique’ circumstances that it will allow in country applications for those ‘applying to stay in the UK long-term’, whose current visas run out before 31/05/2020. This would mean applicants in this position would no longer have to return to their home countries’ in order to apply. It is also possible to extend your visa to 31/05/2020 if you are unable to return to your home country, if it expires before this date. Doing this does not exclude you from being able to apply to switch in country.</p>
<p>As the Home Office has not provided any lists of accepted visa switches or further details we are working under the assumption that any switch to a long term visa, could be made. This would include, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tier 5 Youth Mobility Scheme to Tier 2 (general)</li>
<li>Tier 2 (dependant) to Tier 2 (general)</li>
<li>Visit visa to any long term visa.</li>
<li>Visit visa to ancestry visa.</li>
<li>Marriage visit visa to any long term visa.</li>
</ul>
<p>Applications are to be made online and can only be made up until 31/05/2020, although this is up for review and may be further extended if the need should arise. You will still need to pay the same fee and meet all the other requirements of your visa.</p>
<p>This presents a chance for people to save money on an expensive international trip, so if you have been planning to apply for a long term visa, have an expiry date before 31/05/2020, and are already in the UK, now might be a good time to make the switch.</p>
<p>We can help you manage the process of switching in country.

<p>On the 24th of March 2020 the Home Office finally released <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-for-uk-visa-applicants-and-temporary-uk-residents?utm_source=31202869-fd45-4fbc-bc79-e169265b1978&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=govuk-notifications&utm_content=immediate">updated advice</a> for those whose Sunico Immigration are affected by Coronavirus. While this guidance is by no means comprehensive, and leaves a lot of questions unanswered it will still be helpful for a number of people. As such I have summarised the questions it has answered below.</p>
<p><strong>What if my leave is expiring but I can’t return to my country?</strong></p>
<p>This is a common problem, and one which the previous update did not address for the vast majority of people. Thankfully the government has said if you are in the UK and your leave expires between 24/01/2020 and 31/05/2020 you will be able to extend your visa if you cannot leave the UK due to travel restrictions or self isolation.</p>
<p>This will be a relief for those dreading the prospect of international travel, as well as for those whose visas may have already expired and who may be anxious about the long term implications of overstaying. This process is not, however, automatic.</p>
<p>The government has set up a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-for-uk-visa-applicants-and-temporary-uk-residents?utm_source=31202869-fd45-4fbc-bc79-e169265b1978&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=govuk-notifications&utm_content=immediate#helpline">Coronavirus Immigration Team</a> who should be contacted to update your records. You will need to provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your date of birth</li>
<li>Your full name</li>
<li>Your nationality</li>
<li>Your previous visa reference number</li>
<li>The reason you cannot go back to your home country (ie isolation, border closure)</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that if flights are running back to your country and you are not in isolation, you may run into trouble as this concession only appears to apply to those who are physically unable to return, not everyone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Do I have to return to my home country to switch my visa?</strong></p>
<p>The Home Office insists, for reasons best known to itself, that a number of visa applications must be made from the applicant&#8217;s home country, regardless of whether the applicant has existing leave in the UK. These include switching from Tier 5 to Tier 2, and switching from a Tier 2 dependent visa to a Tier 2 general visa. Given the current climate applicants are likely to find this difficult to impossible.</p>
<p>Thankfully the Home Office has indicated that due to these ‘unique’ circumstances that it will allow in country applications for those ‘applying to stay in the UK long-term’. As the Home Office has not provided any lists of accepted visa switches or further details we are working under the assumption that any switch to a long term visa, such as tier 2, could be made.</p>
<p>Applications are to be made online and can only be made up until 31/05/2020, although this is up for review and may be further extended if the need should arise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I’m outside the UK and the Visa application centre in my country has shut. What should I do?</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately a number of overseas visa centres are now shut and you will not be able to apply until they re-open. If you already have an appointment and it has been cancelled, you should follow the instructions from your visa centre on what to do next.</p>
<p>English Language Testing Centres are also affected, so you should keep up to date with the <a href="https://www.ielts.org/news/2020/covid19-information-for-our-global-test-taker-community">IELTS website</a> for information on what to do if your test is cancelled.</p>
<p>If your documents are with a visa centre then you may be able to get them couriered back to you, but you should check with your specific visa centre.</p>
<p>If you are British and need a passport to urgently travel to the UK, you will not be able to apply for this if your country’s visa application centre is shut. You will need to apply for an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/emergency-travel-document">emergency travel document</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I’m a sponsor, what do I need to know?</strong></p>
<p>If you are a Tier 4 sponsor, you should be aware that the government has indicated that in these circumstances it will permit distance learning, which is not normally permissible, where students are overseas but wish to continue studying. There will be no requirement to withdraw sponsorship in this scenario.</p>
<p>Furthermore students who wish to commence a course via distance learning will not need to travel to the UK or be sponsored under Tier 4.</p>
<p>If you are a tier 2 or 5 sponsor, there is a good chance that much of your workforce is suddenly working from home. While you would ordinarily need to report this to the Home Office, if it is as a direct result of the Coronavirus pandemic, you will not need to report this. All other changes of circumstance must be reported as usual.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Other questions</strong></p>
<p>There are a number of other questions which remain unanswered, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether those on visas with ‘no recourse to public funds’ will be eligible for wages through the ‘coronavirus job retention scheme’.</li>
<li>Whether Tier 2 employees can be ‘furloughed’.</li>
<li>How long Tier 2 employees will have to find another sponsor should they be made redundant, or their sponsor go bankrupt.</li>
<li>What will happen to people overseas who have been granted visas but now cannot come to the UK within the allowed time frame.</li>

<h1><strong>The New Immigration System and How it Will Affect You.</strong></h1>
<p>On the 19th of February the government released its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uks-points-based-immigration-system-policy-statement?utm_source=adda7e36-20e4-4894-ac9d-dc892abcae49&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=govuk-notifications&utm_content=immediate">plans for immigration</a> from 2021. Find out what impact this could have on you, your business or your students. It should be noted that EU, EEA and Swiss citizens will all remain non-visa nationals, capable of entering for 6 months without a visa under the normal visitor rules.</p>
<h2><strong>Changes to the skills based system</strong></h2>
<p>Despite the government’s claims to reduce low-skilled migration, they will be lowering both the minimum general salary threshold as well as the minimum necessary RQF skill level. The new rules will apply equally to applicants applying from both inside and outside the EU, although not to EU residents already in the country who have settled or pre-settled status.</p>
<p><strong>The minimum salary</strong> will be lowered to £25,600 from £30,000, with the potential to go down to £20,480 if the applicant has strengths awarding them points in other areas (for example working in a shortage occupation or having a relevant PhD). This appears to lead to an counter-intuitive scenario where the stronger the applicant, the less the sponsoring company is required to pay them. It will be interesting to see how the government reconciles this with their pledge to attract the ‘brightest and best’ and to reduce wage undercutting.</p>
<p><strong>The minimum RQF level</strong> of the job will be lowered from RQF6 to RQF3, essentially meaning that the required difficulty level of the job to be offered has gone from one equivalent in experience and difficulty to a Bachelor’s degree, to one equivalent in experience and difficult to A-levels. While this does not cover unskilled entry positions, it is still a big shift in the required skill level in order to sponsor an overseas worker.</p>
<p><strong>The Resident Labour Market Test</strong> will be abolished along with the cap on the number of people who are able to come to the UK on the skilled-worker route.</p>
<p><strong>The Global Talent Scheme</strong> will be opened to EU, EEA and Swiss citizens, allowing highly-skilled scientists and researchers to come to the UK without a job offer. This will also be expanded to be more accessible to those with a background in STEM subjects, although more details on this are not yet available.</p>
<p><strong>The Seasonal Agricultural Visa</strong> pilot scheme is due to be quadrupled (from 2,500 to 10,000) as the government recognises this sector is reliant on low-skilled temporary workers to function. This would allow farms to hire workers for a period of up to 6 months, and is intended to ease pressure on the agricultural sector during busy harvest months. There is no other current path for unskilled workers to enter the UK, which does little to reassure employers in other sectors heavily reliant on unskilled or low-paid workers, including care-work, hospitality and construction.</p>
<h2><strong>International Students and Graduates</strong></h2>
<p>This appears to be largely similar to its current form however there are a few differences. Most obviously the student routes will now be open to EU, EEA and Swiss citizens.</p>
<p>Secondly and perhaps most excitingly for those hoping to study in the UK and work here afterwards, a new immigration route will be opening in 2021. This will allow graduates who complete their degree from summer 2021 to stay for up to 2 years after the end of their degree to work or look for work. They can work at any RQF skill level during this period but if they wished to convert their visa to a skills-based visa at the end of the 2 years they would presumably need to secure a job offer meeting the minimum salary and RQF levels described above.</p>
<h2><strong>What should I do?</strong></h2>
<p>If you are an EU citizen in the UK, we strongly advise applying for the settled or pre-settled scheme as soon as possible to secure your right to live and work in the UK next year.</p>
<p>If you are an employer or educational institute considering sponsoring overseas workers or students in the future, we would advise applying for your sponsor license now. We can assist with this process, so call us on +44-741-836-4727 or emails us at <a href="../../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e980878f86a99c829f809a889ac78a86c79c82">[email&#160;protected]</a> to arrange a consultation.</p>

<p><strong>&#8220;No Automatic Deportation After Brexit&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>This has been the latest revelation from Boris Johnson regarding the settlement of EU citizens in the UK after Brexit. On the face of it this seems like a very positive message to EU citizens concerned about their future in the UK after Brexit, but let’s examine what it really means for EU migrants and their employers.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Does this mean people who fail to apply for settled status by the deadline will be allowed to stay after all?</strong></p>
<p>In short, unlikely. The government has indicated that in order to avoid deportation after missing the deadline, EU migrants must ‘give grounds for why it was not possible to apply in the timeline, if no valid reason is given then the valid immigration rules will be applied.’ It is not clear exactly what the government would regard as a ‘valid reason’ but it is likely to be a difficult threshold to meet given that applicants have got until 30 June 2021 to apply and they have been able to apply since 30th of March 2019.</p>
<p>This would suggest that an applicant would need to provide evidence of a compelling impediment to application which spanned over 2 years. It is unlikely many people would be able to satisfy this criteria. While the wording of ‘valid immigration rules will be applied’ deliberately avoids the term ‘removal’, it is clear that this may be the fate of those who fail to apply in time.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Can those who have not yet applied for settled status continue to work in the UK now we have left the EU?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. While a survey by the grassroots organisation &#8216;the3million&#8217; indicates that 1 in 10 EU citizens have already been asked to provide evidence of their settled status, this is not a legal requirement. EU citizens may continue to work without applying for settled status throughout the transition period. A lack of clarity in government communications has left employers and employees alike confused as to what their duties are, but until the end of the transition period, EU workers can continue to work, although they should still aim to complete the settlement application at their earliest convenience.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What kind of proof will people receive of their settled status?</strong></p>
<p>Controversially, the government has elected to provide no physical documentation confirming the settled status of EU migrants. All records will be electronic which the government claims will “future-proof [applicants] rights and is linked to their passport or ID card, replacing physical documents which can get lost, stolen, damaged, tampered with and expire”. 90% of survey participants however indicated they feared discrimination without a form of physical evidence which can be shown to employers, banks or landlords, and would prefer a card.</p>
<p>Maike Bohn, co-founder of the3million has warned that the government is setting itself up for another Windrush crisis by failing to provide physical evidence which applicants may be able to later use to prove their right to live in the UK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Migration Advisory Committee has released an <a href="../../government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/873155/PBS_and_Salary_Thresholds_Report_MAC_word_FINAL.pdf">extensive report</a> on the Points-Based System and Salary Thresholds. This was commissioned by the Government in July and September of last year.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering how the system might affect you, or your employees, then read on for a brief introduction to the new system as imagined by the MAC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What might change?</strong></p>
<p>The 278-page report advises against a full-scale ‘Australian-style’ points-based system. Instead, it recommends retaining the existing Tier 2 structure with an addition of lower skill-level jobs and a lower salary threshold from the current £30,000 per year.</p>
<ul>
<li>Foreign nationals hoping to come to the UK may now be able to do so without a job offer if they score high enough on the points system.</li>
<li>The report recommends the existing tier 2 system remain in place, with a salary threshold, as a route for migrants with a job offer. They do however recommend that this route be expanded to include medium skilled workers.</li>
<li>Potentially the threshold for migrants settling under the tier 2 route may be paused and the requirements for settlement reviewed to increase flexibility. This is due to concerns that required pay progression is too steep for settlement.</li>
<li>There may be greater flexibility in the salary thresholds for those that come to the UK as full-time workers then transition to part time after having a child.</li>
<li>Overhaul the Tier 1 Exceptional Talent route and re-design it is using a points-based system but add safeguards to prevent abuse.</li>
<li>Introduce a separate pilot visa for ‘remote’ parts of the UK, which could include a lower salary threshold exemption.</li>
<li>Review the Shortage Occupation List after the new immigration system is introduced</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Factors like age, education, work experience and English language ability are likely to be taken into account. It is not yet clear how the government will weight each factor.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What about the income threshold?</strong></p>
<p>Until now foreign workers looking to come to the UK to work must have a job offer paying more than £30,000. The Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) however has just recommended that this be dropped to £25,600 in order to boost recruitment of skilled NHS staff and teachers who are unlikely to meet the current threshold.</p>
<p>The current system is a complex mix of occupation specific thresholds relating to average earnings in a specific sector, worker experience, and a general threshold. The MAC indicated this could be profitably improved by having new entrant rates at 70% of the experienced rate, and using national pay scales to calculate thresholds in sectors like education and the NHS.</p>
<p>They also recommend that differences in average pay across regions should not be taken into account, with one threshold for the entirety of the UK, citing concerns that lower thresholds in certain parts of the UK risk ‘institutionalising’ some parts of the UK as ‘lower wage’, as well as adding unnecessary complexity.</p>
<p>While some stakeholders would prefer no threshold aside from the minimum wage, the MAC justifies the continued wage threshold by arguing that it prevents the undercutting of the labour market (i.e. employing migrants because they are cheaper than British nationals), ensures migrants are making net positive contributions and makes sure that policy supports the current government’s “ambition to make the UK a high wage, high skill, high productivity economy&#8221;.</p>
<p>Concerns that sectors such as social care will still fail to meet this lower threshold and may suffer staffing shortages have been dismissed, claiming “the root cause of the problems there is the failure to offer competitive terms and conditions”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will watch with bated breath to see if these recommendations actually result in any material changes in immigration policy. <a href="../../new-australian-style-immigration-policy/index.htm">As we have said  before</a>, the introduction of the &#8220;Australian&#8221; points based system was never anything ground-breaking, so it will be interesting to see how the current government works to implement these MAC recommendations.</p>

<p>While one of the current government’s selling points has been its pledge to crack down on immigration and to reduce the overall number of people coming to the UK, it has chosen to review the income threshold of 30K which prospective workers would have to meet in order to enter the UK. Let’s explore what this means in practice:</p>
<p><strong>What’s the current system?</strong></p>
<p>The current system for non-EU workers to come to the UK to work requires applicants to meet several stringent conditions. Applicants must currently meet an income threshold, although this varies based on the vocation, as well as the age and experience of the applicant. Applicants must also demonstrate a good knowledge of English.</p>
<p>Companies hoping to employ migrant workers from outside of the EEA also have to prove that they have not been able to find anyone within the UK or the EEA capable of doing the job unless the job is on the shortage occupation list. There is also a cap on the number of workers who can enter if they are not filling a position in a shortage occupation.</p>
<p><strong>What’s Boris proposing?</strong></p>
<p>Boris wants to replace the current system with a more holistic points-based system under which income would be taken into account alongside English ability, occupation, and qualification.  Each contributing factor would be assigned points, and the point total used to decide on whether the person would be a benefit to the UK.</p>
<p><strong>What will change?</strong></p>
<p>Critics of the current system argue that the income cap severely restricts the ability of industries which employ workers who are skilled but not particularly well-paid to fill positions. This includes the NHS, farm-workers and other industries which currently rely on EU workers to do low paid but skilled or crucial work.</p>
<p>Boris has pledged to cut ‘unskilled’ immigration but has not set out exactly who he will class as an ‘unskilled’ worker. This raises concern over the ability of organisations reliant on EU labour, such as care homes, to recruit enough staff, should their staff not be considered ‘skilled’ workers.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the removal of the wage cap will make the UK more appealing to skilled workers in low-paying industries to contribute to the UK economy, as well as mitigating some of the potential labour shortages as a result of Brexit.</p>

<p>We are delighted to announce that our fees for 2020 remain largely unchanged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, we have decided reluctantly and after much soul-searching, to increase our charges relating to sponsor licence procurement and ongoing administration from 1 April 2020.  This is simply because it is becoming more and more time-consuming to a) prepare a robust licence application in the first place and b) to provide the administrative support and advice to clients and manage/report the increasing number of changes taking place across the four-years licence period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our fees for assisting with a sponsor licence application, together with the provision of four years administrative support and advice, will therefore increase to £1950 + VAT for small organisations and £2950 + VAT for large organisations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For renewing licences, together with the provision of four years administrative support and advice, our fees will increase to £1450 + VAT for small organisations and £2450 + VAT for large organisations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These increases will now include managing major changes such as takeovers, acquisitions and adding new categories such as ICT to a licence.</p>

<p>We are pleased to welcome the following new staff who joined Sunico Immigration in January 2020</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As our business continues to grow we are delighted to welcome <strong>Holly Smith</strong> to our case-working team.  Holly graduated in law at The University of Reading in 2014 and then took time out to teach English in Japan, where she acquired her Japanese language skills!  After 18 months working on a major project for Deloitte she has now decided to focus on immigration so joins us here as a Legal Assistant reporting to Garima Arora.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of you will have had dealings with our accounts controller Nigel VanYperen over the years.  Sadly he became ill in the summer of 2019 and no longer feels well enough to continue working with us, so made the difficult decision to resign shortly before Christmas.  We wish him and his family the very best for the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To take over his role we have been fortunate to recruit <strong>Pauline Baker</strong>, a qualified AAT accounting technician with several years’ experience, who is quickly getting to grips with the complex nuances associated with the UK immigration service industry.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There has been a radical shake up of the shortage occupation list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the UKVI recently announced a radical revision of the Shortage Occupation List which defines roles that employers can offer to migrants without first checking local labour availability. Its purpose is to expedite recruitment for roles that are traditionally difficult to fill.</p>
<p>In the past, the types of roles on the list were considered specialist, but the latest additions include more commonplace occupations such as IT professionals, nurses, and social workers, further indication that the government has acknowledged the skills shortage is affecting areas of the jobs market that were previously considered well serviced.</p>
<p>A full list of jobs on the shortage occupation list can be found in Appendix K of the Tier 2 immigration rules here: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-k-shortage-occupation-list">https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-k-shortage-occupation-list</a></p>
