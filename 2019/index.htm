<p>As we reach the end of 2019, we approach not only a new year and a new decade, but also a new era for the United Kingdom’s international status. Now that Boris Johnson has firmly established his government’s control, we can expect Brexit negotiations to be finalised soon, with the Prime Minister targeting withdrawal from the EU on January 31st 2020.</p>
<p>What does this mean for the future of the country’s immigration system? As part of their election manifesto, the Conservatives laid out plans for what they claimed were revolutionary changes to the current system, including a new NHS visa and an Australian points-based process. But how much of this was really new, and how much was just electioneering? Let’s take a look at what we know so far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>NHS visa</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During her speech in the House of Commons, which signalled the start of the Parliamentary year, the Queen revealed part of her government’s immigration plans to support the NHS: “A new visa will ensure qualified doctors, nurses and health professionals have fast-track entry to the United Kingdom.”</p>
<p>Boris Johnson went into more detail on these plans back on the campaign trail in November. The changes he mentioned included:</p>
<ul style="float: left;">
<li>The application cost of a visa for medical professionals would be reduced from £928 to £464</li>
<li>A decision on the application would be guaranteed within two weeks</li>
<li>The minimum salary requirement of £30,000 for skilled migrants seeking five-year visas will be scrapped</li>
</ul>
<p>However, dig deeper and these plans start to look less like a radical overhaul of the current system and more like tinkering around the edges.</p>
<p>For one thing, NHS doctors and nurses are already on the shortage occupation list and pay £464 for their visas, so this is misleading information unless Johnson meant it will be a £464 fixed fee for both a three-year and a five-year visa (a five-year visa is currently £928).</p>
<p>For another, visas on standard service are decided within 15 working days, and for an extra £220 overseas applicants will get the decision in five working days. Therefore, the Conservatives’ target of a two-week delivery is only five working days less than the current timeframe, which, as this <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/nov/17/migrants-home-office-super-priority-visa-service-problems">article</a> mentions, isn’t guaranteed as it is.</p>
<p>Therefore, in terms of real change, this really just leaves the scrapping of the £30,000 salary threshold for health professionals applying for a five-year visa.</p>
<p>This is certainly a welcome change. With an ongoing skills shortage continuing to impact the NHS, reducing the threshold will make it easier to recruit nurses and other health professionals on lower wages from outside the UK. And with their stated intention to also remove the cap on the number of migrant health professionals allowed into the country each year, it should help health services to recruit for much-needed positions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Australian points-based system</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“A modern, fair, points-based immigration system will welcome skilled workers from across the world to contribute to the United Kingdom’s economy, communities and public services.”</p>
<p>This statement of intent, also from the Queen’s Speech, is another part of the government’s claims to initiate radical reform of the UK’s immigration system, but, as with those made around the NHS visa, there is little new here to impress the well-informed.</p>
<p>We already have a points-based system for non-EU nationals. This was introduced in 2008 and was itself based on the Australian points-based system but has, over the past decade, become frustrated by complexity and increasingly stringent rules.</p>
<p>As visa and immigration advisors working with UK immigration policy on a daily basis, we’re the first to welcome change if it addresses the difficulties inherent in the current system. The UK needs a points-based model that meets our industry needs. However, while it is early days for this government, so far the changes to the UK immigration system they’ve set out seem to be focused more on satisfying their voter base rather than bringing about the changes necessary for industry.</p>
<p>As ever, we will be keeping a close eye on events and ensuring that we remain up-to-date and compliant with any changes to UK immigration policy. As this article shows, it’s a complicated business fraught with pitfalls, which is why we always recommend soliciting the support of an expert.

<div class="entry-content" id="post-entry-content">
<p>According to a report by the British Chamber of Commerce, three quarters of UK businesses are struggling to fill vacant roles in their organisations. The <a href="https://www.britishchambers.org.uk/news/2019/05/bcctotaljobs-no-business-sector-immune-from-recruitment-difficulties"><strong>second Quarterly Recruitment Outlook</strong> </a>for 2019 shows that while 53% of 6,000 businesses polled attempted to hire new employees, 73% of them found it difficult to successfully recruit for these roles.</p>
<p>The report places the blame on a lack of skilled candidates, and with Brexit still on the cards, the situation is only likely to get worse. If EU nationals become subject to the same UK Visa restrictions as other overseas candidates, the pool of freely available qualified talent will become even more limited. The situation has wider implications for our economy, and a solution must be found within the next few months if UK businesses are to continue to operate effectively.</p>
<p>As a response to the growing crisis, the UK government has announced a radical revision of the Shortage Occupation List (SOL). The list defines jobs that employers can offer to migrants without first checking local labour availability, and its purpose is to expedite recruitment for roles that are traditionally difficult to fill.</p>
<p>In the past, the types of roles on the list were considered specialist, but the latest additions include more commonplace occupations such as IT professionals, nurses, and social workers, further indication that the government has acknowledged the skills shortage is affecting areas of the jobs market that were previously considered well serviced.</p>
<p>The news that the SOL has been expanded will be welcomed by UK employers, but this measure alone is not enough to avoid an impending national recruitment crisis.</p>
<p>While the number of occupations on the list has risen dramatically, the 20,700 cap on the number of migrant workers that can enter the UK each year has not. When this limit has been reached, UK firms will be unable to employ any more overseas workers for the rest of the year, regardless of whether their occupations are on the SOL or not.</p>
<p>Our Managing Director, Jamie Bryant, comments: “The reason for the unchanged cap may be due to the government’s pledge to reduce net migration, but this is at odds with the realities of the situation; until a domestic solution to the skills shortage can be found, UK businesses must be able to rely on overseas workers to fill positions.”</p>
<p>“The government needs to acknowledge this and raise the annual cap on migrant workers accordingly. Until they do, it will only be a matter of time before Britain’s businesses, and therefore its residents, suffer the consequences of understaffing.”</p>

<p>Every year, thousands of UK visa applications are rejected by the Home Office as a result of mistakes made either by the applicant or their sponsor. Something as seemingly trivial as submitting a photograph in the wrong format can lead to the application being rejected and the process having to be started again.</p>
<p>Has the government made the process deliberately difficult? Possibly. Considering its pledge to reduce net migration, this could indeed be the case, but one thing is for certain – for those responsible for the recruitment and employment of overseas workers in their organisations, the prospect of having a visa application refused should be a major cause for concern.</p>
<p>The application process is far from straightforward, requiring in-depth knowledge of the immigration rules and complicated documentation. For small and medium-sized businesses without their own dedicated immigration teams, the time and subsequent cost involved in securing working visas for employees is significant, and a rejected application can have further serious financial implications.</p>
<p>To help demonstrate the wide range of potential pitfalls, here are some of the most common reasons why UK visa applications are rejected:</p>
<p><strong>1. Problems with Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS)</strong></p>
<p>Employers need to issue a valid Certificate of Sponsorship, or CoS, if they’re to employ an overseas worker legally. Assigning an incorrect or invalid CoS to a prospective employee could lead to the application being rejected or, even if approved, a potential fine of up to £20,000 for the employer, and the loss of their sponsor licence for employing a worker illegally.</p>
<p><strong>2. Failure to carry out Resident Labour Market Test (RLMT)</strong></p>
<p>Before they can hire a Tier 2 visa worker, employers may need to show they were unable to find a suitable worker from within the UK. Failure to meet the requirements of the RLMT may result in the application being rejected or their subsequent removal from the UK if identified during a UKVI compliance visit.</p>
<p><strong>3. Inadequate supporting documentation</strong></p>
<p>Supporting documents with missing or incomplete information or that are incorrectly formatted are a common reason why visa applications are rejected.</p>
<p><strong>4. Incorrect SOC code</strong></p>
<p>Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) codes are used to define the skill and salary level for occupations. Assign the wrong code and the application could be delayed or rejected.</p>
<p><strong>5. Insufficient maintenance funds</strong></p>
<p>The application will be rejected if the applicant can’t show they’ve enough money to support themselves when they arrive in the UK.</p>
<p><strong>6. Mistakes in the application form</strong></p>
<p>Something as simple as an incorrectly typed digit in a contact number can be enough to result in rejection.</p>
<p>As you can tell from this by no means comprehensive list, the ways in which a visa application can fail are many and varied, and the potential penalties can be devastating for a business. To avoid falling into one of these traps, we recommend securing the services of an immigration expert to take care of the application process for you.</p>

<p>International students will be allowed to stay in the UK for two years after graduating, reviving the Tier 1 (Post-study) visa that was shelved by the Home Office back in 2012.  Almost 400,000 Tier 1 PSW visas were granted in each of the five year between 2008 and 2012.</p>
<p>Effective from the 2020/21 university intake, those who enrol on undergraduate, postgraduate or PhD courses in the UK will be able to stay in the country to work or look for work for two years after they graduate.</p>
<p>However, unlike the route which closed in 2012, this new route will also include safeguards to ensure only genuine, credible students are eligible.  Previously the post-study route allowed students to find any job, regardless of the skills required.</p>
<p>This announcement follows the creation of a new fast-track visa route for scientists and the removal of the limit on PHD students moving into the skilled work visa route, which collectively aim to cement the UK as a science superpower and a world-leader in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) sector.</p>
<p>There are over 450,000 foreign students in the UK, generating £20 billion per year through education exports, and research shows that they tend to earn considerably more than their UK counterparts once they leave university.</p>
<p>However, the four months “extra time” currently granted to Tier 4 students forces many to leave the UK as they do not have sufficient time or cannot demand a high enough salary to qualify for a sponsored Tier 2 work visa.</p>
<p>Dependant on the restrictions placed on eligibility, this additional two years should prove extremely popular and help make the UK education system more attractive to overseas students once again.</p>

<div class="entry-content" id="post-entry-content">
<p style="text-align: left;">According to the Office for National Statistics, the first quarter of 2019 saw the number of EU nationals employed in Britain hit an <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/timeseries/eq4u/lms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all-time high of almost 2.4 million</a>. Despite ongoing uncertainty surrounding Brexit, UK businesses have continued to invest in recruitment, creating 100,000 new jobs in the first three months of the year, and EU nationals have helped them to fill those positions. However, impending changes to immigration rules are almost certain to affect this trend and create challenges for UK recruiters.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the event of a no-deal Brexit, as of October 31st, EU nationals are likely to become subject to the same restrictions other overseas nationalities currently face when seeking employment in Britain. This means UK businesses who wish to continue employing EU workers post-Brexit are likely to need to hold a valid sponsor licence, and ensure sponsored applicants obtain a valid working visa.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The additional complexity of the recruitment process could lead to UK employers experiencing difficulties in filling vacancies. However, one measure that seeks to avoid this situation is the recent update to the Shortage Occupation List (SOL).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The list defines occupations that are especially under-recruited, and therefore subject to exceptions from immigration employment laws. In anticipation of the possible impact Brexit could have for UK recruiters, the government engaged the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) to review the SOL for the first time since 2013. Published in May 2019, the proposed list includes the additions of such diverse occupations as veterinarians, web designers, and secondary school teachers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Employers recruiting for roles on the SOL can benefit from the following advantages:</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>No need to pass the Resident Labour Market Test (RLMT), which shows an attempt has been made to recruit domestically. This makes a saving for employers in terms of vacancy advertising and recruitment time</li>
<li>These jobs are automatically granted a high level of points in the visa system, so a migrant cannot be turned down for sponsorship, even if the annual cap on the Tier 2 scheme has been reached</li>
<li>The job does not need to meet the minimum salary threshold required for settlement after five years</li>
<li>Visa application fees are lower if the occupation is on the SOL, making it more attractive to foreign applicants and their dependants</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you are involved in recruitment and want to find out more about how Brexit and the changes to the SOL may affect the process, the team at Sunico Immigration can help.</p>

<div class="entry-content" id="post-entry-content">
<p><em>What is the EU Settlement scheme, how does it affect EU workers in Britain, and why should employers take notice?</em></p>
<p>The EU Settlement Scheme is a government programme that allows EU, EEA or Swiss nationals currently living in the UK to apply to remain here following the country’s exit from the European Union. Successful applicants who have lived here for five years or more will be given settled status, while those who have been here for under five years will receive pre-settled status.</p>
<p>It’s imperative that those responsible for the recruitment and management of overseas workers in their companies are aware of the scheme and what is required during the application process. While it’s not yet clear what will happen to EU employees in Britain without a registered status, it’s safe to assume they will no longer be able to work in the country once the deadline has passed. Along with causing disruption for both the worker and their employer, there may also be legal ramifications for both parties.</p>
<p><em>What can I do as an employer to keep my EU employees?</em></p>
<p>Firstly, there are a couple of dates for UK employers and their EU employees to be aware of. If Britain and the EU agree a Brexit deal by the 31st October deadline, then the final date for registering for settled status will be 30th June 2021. However, if no deal is reached, the date moves forward to 31st December 2020. The government’s website explains the process here: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/eusettledstatus">https://www.gov.uk/eusettledstatus</a></p>
<p>As an employer, there are a number of steps you can take to prepare</p>
<p>1. Undertake an audit to identify which of your employees are affected<br>
2. Make use of the factsheets, posters and videos that the government has provided to raise awareness in your workforce<br>
3. Check the expiry date of your Tier 2 sponsor licence. This system is likely to be extended to EU nationals after 2020<br>
4. Make a diary note to conduct Right to Work checks in 2020 in order for your business to remain compliant with new immigration rules<br>
5. Encourage your employees to review the options open to them. For instance, if they are eligible for Permanent Residence it might be more appropriate to apply for that instead of the EU Settlement Scheme</p>
<p>If you’re concerned about the possible pitfalls of the process, the Sunico Immigration immigration team offers expert assistance. Let us help you by:</p>
<p>• Reviewing the status of your EU employees and their family members<br>
• Assisting with applications<br>
• Advising employees of their options<br>
• Performing compliance reviews<br>
• Examining your Right to Work checks and providing advice on best practice post-Brexit</p>

<p>You must inform the Home Office within 10 working days about the following:</p>
<p>1. If your sponsored migrant does not turn up to work on their first day. You must report the reason, for example, sickness, or a missed flight.</p>
<p>2. If your sponsored migrant worker is absent from their job for more than 10 consecutive working days without your permission. Your report must be made within 10 working days of the 10th day of their absence.</p>
<p>3. If a sponsored migrant’s employment ceases earlier than originally intended. You must report their last address and contact number, as well as the name of their new employer, if appropriate.</p>
<p>4. If your migrant worker’s visa status changes, but they are going to carry on working for you (for instance, if they switch to a partner visa from their original Tier 2 sponsored status).</p>
<p>5. If there are significant changes in the particulars of your sponsored migrant’s job. For example, they gain a promotion; take maternity or adoption leave; change their job title; or their salary becomes markedly different from the level that was set on their Certificate of Sponsorship.</p>

<p>7. If your sponsored migrant worker breaks the condition of their leave to remain in the UK for whatever reason.</p>
<p>In addition, you must also inform the Home Office about the following changes to your company’s role as registered sponsor:</p>

<p>On 17th July 2019, the Home Office added an Addendum to
their Tier 2 &amp; 5 – Guidance for employers 03/19 which applies with
immediate effect to all Tier 2 &amp; 5 sponsors, including all current and
future applications seeking to apply for or renew a sponsor licence.</p>
<p>The Home Office states that it “will not license organisations whose actions and behaviour are non-conducive to the public good”. The non-exhaustive list of examples includes:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fostering
hatred or inter-community division;</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fomenting,
justifying or glorifying terrorism; and/or;</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rejecting
the rights of, or discriminating against, other groups or individuals on the
basis of their gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, marital status,
race, religious belief (including lack of belief), or any other protected
characteristic under the Equality Act 2010.</p>
<p>Compliance action can be taken against those who have
engaged in the above behaviour or actions, which could result in the refusal to
grant/renew a licence or the revocation of an existing licence.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how the Home Office will implement these
changes. Previously, it has been seen that the term ‘non-conducive to public
good’ has been applied in non-terrorism-related immigration cases, which
includes discrepancies with the HMRC.</p>
<p>Although the above issues need to be tackled in the
workforce in general and the wider community, it will be interesting to see how
the Home Office tackles these and whether a FTSE 100 company will face the same
repercussions as a small business.&nbsp; </p>

<p>HR managers, is your company Brexit-ready?</p>
<p>As Britain prepares to leave the European Union, it’s
important for UK companies employing EU workers to ensure they’re ready for the
changes that will follow. Those responsible for recruitment should be aware of
these changes and understand what they mean for both the company’s current EU
employees and its future recruitment strategy.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Some steps that can be taken to ensure a smooth transition
for businesses and their employees include:</p>
<p><strong>Keeping your current
EU workers</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, it’s important to ensure that any EU, EEA or Swiss
nationals currently employed by your company can continue to stay in the UK
after 30th June 2021 (if a deal is not agreed, the deadline will be 31st
December 2020). The government’s EU Settlement Scheme gives these people the
opportunity to apply to continue living in the UK following its exit from the
European Union. Applicants who have been here for five years or more will
receive ‘settled’ status, while those who have lived here for less than five
years will get ‘pre-settled’ status.</p>
<p>The process is free, and the government has provided a step-by-step set of instructions on its website to guide applicants. HR officers should familiarise themselves with the process so that they can advise and support any of their company’s employees who need to apply. You can visit the site <strong><a href="https://www.gov.uk/eusettledstatus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="here (opens in a new tab)">here</a></strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Preparing to recruit
from outside the EU</strong></p>
<p>Once Brexit has taken place, the process of hiring workers
from the EU will become more difficult. As a result, companies may choose to
start recruiting people from further afield, although they will need to prepare
for this shift in focus.</p>
<p>According to a recent survey, 76% of businesses have no
contingency funds for future recruitment outside the EU. The cost, in terms of
both money and time, of sponsorship licences and Tier 2 Visas means companies
must determine whether they can afford to hire from abroad, as well as identify
the resources necessary to carry out their recruitment plans.</p>
<p><strong>What is a Tier 2 (General)
Visa and why do workers need them?</strong></p>
<p>Tier 2 (General) Visas are the most common type of visa.
They apply to skilled workers earning £30,000 a year and upwards, and require
sponsorship from the company offering employment. Proof of sponsorship comes in
the form of a certificate of sponsorship (CoS).</p>
<p>Once Britain has left the EU, EU citizens without settled or
pre-settled UK status may be subject to the same rules that apply to people
from the rest of the world, meaning they will need to apply for a Tier 2 Visa
if they intend to work in the UK.</p>
<p><strong>How much does an
overseas Tier 2 Visa application cost for a single applicant on a 3-year
contract?</strong></p>
<ul><li>Application fee &#8211; £610 </li><li>Immigration health charge &#8211; £1,200</li><li>Immigration skills charge (per year of contract)
£1,092 to £3,000 (depending on whether your company is categorised as large or
small)</li><li>Certificate of Sponsorship £199 </li><li>Priority visa service £220</li></ul>
<p>Due to the cost, complexity, and
potential pitfalls of the visa application process, recruiters would be wise to
work with an expert in the field. At Sunico Immigration, our team guides companies
through the hurdles of bringing staff into the UK, and facilitates the movement
of employees globally.</p>

<p>Having announced earlier in the year that our fees would remain unchanged for 2019, the additional work and time involved managing Tier 2 visa applications here in the UK has now become more onerous even than managing out-of-country applications – which we charged a higher figure for previously.</p>
<p>It is with reluctance therefore that we have had to amend our Tier 2 visa fees for in-country applications to match those for out-of-country applications, so all Tier 2 visas will, with effect from 1 June 2019, be charged at £1150 + VAT.</p>
<p>However, we have also decided to reduce our fee for dependants from £350 + VAT to £250 + VAT, so for a family of three the cost will remain the same as before.</p>
<p>And additionally, as all service options involve the same amount of work for us now, our fee of £1150 + VAT will apply whether clients opt for standard, priority or super priority service.</p>

<p>Procedures for submitting Tier 2 visa applications in the UK have become far more complex and time-consuming since the appointment of the Home Office’s commercial partner Sopra Steria to run the UKVCAS service points around the UK.</p>
<p>Applicants submitting their applications inside the UK no longer have the option to send in their passports and BRP cards by post. Instead all UK based applicants must upload electronic copies of their supporting documents.</p>
<p>Although this means that applicants are able to retain their passports whilst their application is being processed, it does not mean that they are free to travel.  They must remain in the UK until they have received a decision on their application and their new BRP cards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the applicant were to leave the country after their application has been submitted and they have enrolled their biometrics but before a decision has been made, their application would be deemed to be withdrawn.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the changes introduced also mean that applicants are no longer able to enrol their biometrics at a local Post Office. The biometric enrolment fee of £19.20 is now included in the cost of the Tier 2 visa at the point when it is submitted and all applicants must attend an appointment at one of the UKVCAS service points run by the Home Office’s commercial partner, Sopra Steria.</p>
<p>These appointments have to be booked in advance and at many of the service points, there are additional fees ranging from £60-£260 per applicant depending on the time and location of the appointment.</p>
<p>Free appointments are only available at the six core service points in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Belfast</li>
<li>Birmingham</li>
<li>Cardiff</li>
<li>Croydon</li>
<li>Glasgow</li>
<li>Manchester</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, these free appointments have to take place between core hours of 10am and 4pm from Monday to Friday and usually have to be booked at least two weeks in advance.</p>
<p>If the applicants want to attend an appointment at one of these sites with less than two weeks’ notice or outside of core hours, there will be an additional charge of £100 per applicant.</p>
<p>There are another 50 enhanced service points dotted around the country, which offer appointments during the week between the core hours of 10am and 4pm at a cost of £60 per applicant. If the applicants require an appointment at one of these enhanced service points at short notice or outside of core hours, the additional charge is £125 per applicant.</p>
<p>Appointments can also be booked in the Premium Lounge at 20 Mark Lane, London EC3R 7AF and are usually available up to 28 days in advance. However, there is a fee of £200 per applicant for appointments at the Premium Lounge during core hours of Monday to Friday between 10am and 4pm.</p>
<p>For urgent appointments at the Premium Lounge or for appointments outside of core hours, the additional fee rises to £260 per applicant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The processing time for a decision on an application only starts from the date of the appointment to enrol biometrics</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>With the standard service costing £723.20 per applicant, most people will get a decision on their application within 8 weeks of attending their biometrics appointment.</li>
<li>With the priority service costing £1223.20 per applicant, most people will get a decision on their application within 5 working days of attending their biometrics appointment.</li>
<li>With the super priority service costing £1523.20 per person, most people get a decision on their application on the next working day after attending their biometrics appointment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Please note that applicants are required to choose which service they want for their application at the point of submission, but they must do so before they have booked their biometrics appointment and once an application has been submitted it cannot be amended. </strong><strong>So even if the applicant chooses to submit their application using the</strong> <strong>super priority service, there is no guarantee</strong> <strong>that they will be able to get a biometrics appointment straight away.</strong></p>

<p>There have been a few changes to minimum salaries for roles at RQF Level 6 and above.</p>
<p>As is usual at this time of the year the Home Office have made changes to the minimum salary requirements for “New Entrants” – those under 26 or graduates switching in-country – and “Experienced Workers”. However these changes are generally slight, and some have even fallen. Typical examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Civil Engineers: NE: £25,700 up to £27,500. EW: £31,600 up to £33,300</li>
<li>Quantity Surveyors: NE: £23,400 down to £22,600. EW: £30,400 up to £31,800.</li>
<li>IT Project Managers: NE: no change at £31,200. EW: £36,000 up to £39,900</li>
<li>Veterinarians: NE:£25,200 up to £27,100. EW £32,300 up to £36,300</li>
<li>Sales Accounts and BDM’s: £25,100 up to £26,500. EW: £33,300 up to £34,800</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that these figures are based on a 39-hour week. All of the new minimum salary requirements can be found in Appendix J of the Tier 2 immigration rules by going to this link:</p>

<p>For those clients on Auto Renewal (about half of you) your new allocation for this year can be seen on the SMS – go to sponsor summary and scroll down to Tier 2 (General) and Tier 2 (ICT) CoS and the new number available will be shown – this is usually equal to the number issued last year.  If you didn’t issue any, or may need more this year, then we can always request additional CoS for you.</p>
<p>For those not on automatic renewal, a few sponsors have been allocated one or two but generally most are starting the new year off without any.  But, as stated above, if you may need any this year, then we can always request additional CoS for you. We usually need to provide detailed reasons why a CoS is required, eg: the vacancy details and/or candidate details.</p>
<p>Remember of course that for all out-of-country applications, we still have to request restricted CoS at the monthly panel.</p>

<p>The future immigration arrangements for EU citizens and their family members will be set out in UK Immigration Rules as is the case now for non-EU nationals. The proposed visa routes will be opened in autumn 2020, to enable those who wish to come to the UK to apply in good time. (Read more)</p>
<p>So effectively, there will be a single route which gives access to highly skilled and skilled workers from all countries. Those coming to the UK on this route will need an employer to sponsor them and applicants may add their spouse/partner and children as dependants.</p>
<p>Currently there is a cap on numbers coming into the UK and this will be lifted along with the need for a resident labour market test. The Home Office are also claiming they will make the new system as straightforward and light touch as possible, and low cost to employers.</p>
<p>It also looks likely that Tier 5 YMS visa holders will be able to switch into Tier 2 “in-country” rather than having to go home to apply.</p>
<p>The new skilled route will include workers with intermediate level skills, at RQF 3-5 level (A level or equivalent) as well as graduate and post-graduate, as the MAC recommended. The MAC recommended retaining the minimum salary threshold at £30,000 and the Home Office say they will engage with businesses and employers as to what salary threshold should be set.</p>
<p>There will NOT be a route for low skilled workers although the Home Office recognises the challenges faced by these employers, particularly in sectors like construction and social care, who would find it difficult immediately to adapt. They are proposing, as a transitional measure, to institute a time-limited route for temporary short-term workers. This route will allow people to come for a maximum of 12 months, with a cooling-off period of a further 12 months to prevent people effectively working in the UK permanently.</p>
<p>Although the Home Office do not intend to open sectoral labour schemes, they may consider running one for seasonal agricultural work, and so will be running a small-scale pilot scheme for agricultural workers in 2019.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>For EEA nationals already here in the UK</strong> their situation is much more secure and they can apply for either settled or pre-settled status depending on how long they have been in the UK.</p>
<p>Come 29<sup>th</sup> March 2019, or later if the deadline is extended, all EEA nationals who wish to remain here after 31 December 2020 must apply for “pre-settled status” document &#8211; if they have been here for less than five years &#8211; or “settled status” document if they have been here over five years.  This document shows they have had the right to live and work here prior to 29<sup>th</sup> March 2019 ie: before Brexit.</p>
<p>Your EEA staff who have been here for over five years already can, if they wish, apply for “permanent residency” now.  This would entitle them to apply for British citizenship 12 months later, but they may still have to apply for a settled status document to accompany their application.</p>

<p>No changes to our fees but Health surcharge doubles (Read more)</p>
<p>We are pleased to advise you that our fees will remain unchanged for the 2019 calendar year.  Although some elements of our work have become more complicated our determination to provide an excellent service at competitive prices remains a hugely important driver for us as a business.</p>
<p>Home Office charges usually change on 6 April, and are not made public until the very last minute, but there has been one major change: the Health Surcharge for Tier 2 applicants doubled on 8 January, from £200 p.a. to £400 p.a.</p>
<p>The Home Office have also recently opened a number of UKVCAS centres across the UK. These centres are managed by the Home Office’s commercial partner, Sopra Steria and are replacing the Premium Service Centres, which previously allowed applicants to receive a decision on the same day.</p>
<p>Appointments at the Premium Lounge in Central London are usually available at short notice but attract an additional payment of at least £200 per applicant. There are a further six core locations in Belfast, Birmingham, Cardiff, Croydon, Glasgow and Manchester offering appointments during office hours, but applicants may have to wait up to 24 hours (or slightly longer in some cases) for a decision. Appointments are also available at evenings, weekends and at short notice (on the day/next day) with additional prices starting from £100.</p>
<p>Sopra Steria are also offering enhanced user-pay services in 50 local libraries, with prices starting from £60. In these locations, applicants can submit their biometrics and upload copies of their documents, rather than sending originals to the Home Office. Please note though that even if the applicants retain their passports after visiting one of these centres, they must not travel until they have received a decision on their application.</p>

<p>The Home Office are on the look-out for sudden increases to salaries where these neatly satisfy ILR requirements.</p>
<p>The minimum salary requirement for ILR is currently £35,500 p.a., and this increases again in April to £35,800 p.a. Some employers, whose staff fall under this limit, increase salaries just in time to satisfy the ILR requirement, but the Home Office are now looking more closely at these increases. They may ask to see appraisal records to show how salaries are reviewed and any criteria applied to justify such increases.</p>
<p>So if you employ staff whose salaries fall well under the £35,800 limit, you may wish to consider increasing these in stages over time to avoid these questions being asked.  Needless to say, any increases must be appropriate to the work the sponsored worker is carrying out.</p>

<p>All sponsors must ensure that all non-EEA staff or potential recruits have current visas.</p>
<p>If an employee has applied for a new visa or an extension to their current one, and their current visa expires whilst their case is under consideration, it is the employers’ responsibility to check with the Home Office that they can continue to employ that person.</p>
<p>This can be done by logging on to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/view-right-to-work">https://www.gov.uk/view-right-to-work</a>  If the result is inconclusive it will lead you to a second link which is the employer checking service where further checks can be made: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/employee-immigration-employment-status">https://www.gov.uk/employee-immigration-employment-status</a></p>
<p>This enables UK employers to confirm whether a non-EEA national holding either a biometric residence permit or biometric residence card has a current right to work in the UK and whether they are subject to any restrictions.</p>
<p>From the end of January 2019, employers will be able to request either the online check or the existing document-based check; online checks will be a voluntary option whilst migrants and employers develop familiarity with the new service. The digital status checking services will provide a quick and secure verification of status.</p>

<p><strong>Updating your records</strong></p>
<p>All sponsors should ensure their records are kept up to date, but here is a three-point reminder for you.</p>
<p>At least once a year, you should ensure that you ask to see all non-EEA workers passports and visas/BRP cards. Please check these are valid and photocopy them (passport outer cover and details page and both sides of the BRP card (or visa in their passport if they still do not have a BRP card).  Then sign and date the photocopies and place on their personnel file.</p>
<p>Check to see if any sponsored workers’ roles or salaries/working hours have changed or if they are no longer working for you. If so please let us know at <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#7e171018113e0b1508170d1f0d501d11500b15"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e78e898188a7928c918e948694c98488c9928c">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> so we can update the SMS for you or advise you if the change is so significant that a new visa may be required.  Remember, sponsored workers can only carry out the work stated on their CoS.</p>
<p>Please let us know as soon as possible if:</p>
<ol>
<li>your office address is changing.</li>
<li>sponsored staff are changing their work address (eg: those working at client sites).</li>
<li>your Authorising Officer is leaving or going on maternity leave.</li>
<li>your business has changed its name.</li>
<li>your business has been acquired.</li>
<li>your business has acquired another business.</li>

<p>Sponsors that are not on automatic annual renewal will receive monthly e-mails asking them to submit their requests for a CoS allocation.</p>
<p>Annual CoS allocations are for unrestricted CoS only, so can only be issued to people already in the UK, i.e current employees requiring an extension to their visas or new recruits, who are either graduates switching from Tier 4 student visas or those already working for another sponsor on a <a href="https://sunicoimmigration.com/visa_services/working-visas/">Tier 2 General visa</a>.</p>
<p>Sunico Immigration will go through every client’s list of sponsored workers over the next few weeks and request CoS for any whose visas expire between April 2019 and April 2020.</p>
<p>Please note too that you can still ask for additional CoS after 6 April. We just need the name, nationality and DoB of each applicant and, if they are new recruits, full details of the role, salary and resident test details if relevant.</p>
<p>For those clients on Auto Renewal, we have to wait until 6 April and see what you have been allocated and then, if necessary, request extra CoS for you.</p>
