<p>In the newest statement of changes the Home Office has announced a variety of new visa routes to cover a variety of scenarios as well as the abolition of some existing routes. In this series we will address each of them in turn with a summary of what we know about them so far.</p>
<p>We will start with the Global Business Mobility Route which will be replacing the Intra-Company Transfer visa as well as the Sole Representative of an Overseas Business visa. It is comprised of several pathways which we will discuss below. For all routes applicants cannot be present in the UK for more than 5 years in every 6. All positions must also be skill level RQF 6 or higher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><u>Senior or Specialist Worker</u></strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This route replaces most aspects of the Intra-Company transfer route. It is suitable for sponsoring firms that already are established in the UK. Workers on this route will require sponsorship. In many respects it closely resembles the Intra-Company transfer route and firms hoping to sponsor individuals will need to first apply for a sponsor license before being able to bring applicants over.</p>
<p>The key features at a glance are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applicants must have ordinarily been working for an overseas branch of the firm linked by common ownership or control, for a minimum of 12 months, unless they are making over £73,900 or applying as a graduate.</li>
<li>Applicants must earn at least £42,400 per annum or the going rate for the job, whichever is higher.</li>
<li>Applicants on the Graduate route must earn at least £23,100 or 70% of the going rate for the job, whichever is higher.</li>
<li>Supplementary employment is not permitted and the applicant must only work for the sponsoring company.</li>
<li>Applicants may bring dependant partners or children under the age of 18.</li>
<li>Settlement is not permitted for either the main applicant or their dependants.</li>
<li>There is a cap on the length of time applicants can spend in the UK on this route dependent on their salary.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><u>Secondment Worker</u></strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a new addition to the roster. The details of how it will work still require some clarification, but so far we know that route is branded as being intended for overseas workers who are “being seconded to the UK as part of a high value contract or investment by their employer overseas”. The details of what would count as a high value contract is not defined in the rules, and we will need to await further guidance on this. The MAC recommendations suggested a threshold of £50 million which would limit the scope of widespread accessibility to this route.</p>
<p>The key features at a glance are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The visa can be granted for up to 12 months at a time and 2 years total (previously secondments came solely under the visit visa rules and were therefore limited to stays of 6 months at a time).</li>
<li>This route will require sponsorship.</li>
<li>There will need to be a registered contract with the overseas business for the applicant.</li>
<li>Settlement is not permitted.</li>
<li>Applicants may bring dependant partners or children under the age of 18.</li>
<li>Applicants must have 12 months tenure with the overseas business, with no exemption for high earners.</li>
<li>Pending further clarification, it seems likely the role will require roles to be at least RQF level 6.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><u>Service Supplier</u></strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This route is covered by the International Trade Agreement and is designed to cover temporary work assignments in the UK. It is for workers who are either service suppliers employed by an overseas service provider, or independent self-employed professionals based overseas.</p>
<p>The key features at a glance are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applicants must have a sponsor to issue a Certificate of Sponsorship.</li>
<li>Applicants must have been working with the overseas service provider for a period of at least 12 months. There is no exemption for high earners.</li>
<li>The UK sponsor issuing the Certificate of Sponsorship must have a contract with the overseas service provider. The contract must be registered with the Home Office.</li>
<li>This route does not lead to settlement.</li>
<li>Applicants may bring dependant partners or children under the age of 18.</li>
<li>The job must be at the appropriate skill level for the visa.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><u>UK Expansion Worker</u></strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This route will be replacing the Sole Representative of an Overseas Business visa. This constitutes a big change as the Sole Representative visa was not previously considered a part of the Points Based System.</p>
<p>The key features at a glance are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applicants will require a certificate of sponsorship, and we are awaiting details on how sponsorship under this route will work.</li>
<li>Applicants are not permitted to settle under this route.</li>
<li>Applicants are able to be a majority shareholder, which constitutes a change from the sole representative visa.</li>
<li>Less decision making authority is required than for the sole representative visa, but we are awaiting further details on what this might look like.</li>
<li>Applicants may bring dependant partners or children under the age of 18.</li>
<li>Applicants must have been working for the sponsor group for at least 12 months or qualify as a high earner.</li>
<li>Salary must be £42,400 or 100% of the going rate for the role, whichever is higher.</li>
<li>Applicants must be able to certify their own maintenance or have already been present legally in the UK for a minimum of 12 months, and this cannot be certified on a Certificate of Sponsorship.</li>
<li>Permission will be granted for up to 2 years.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2686" src="https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/stethoscope-1584223_1280-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/stethoscope-1584223_1280-300x225.jpg 300w, https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/stethoscope-1584223_1280-768x576.jpg 768w, https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/stethoscope-1584223_1280-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/stethoscope-1584223_1280.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></h1>
<p>I have written previously about the <a href="https://sunicoimmigration.com/the-health-and-care-visa-and-care-workers-what-is-it-and-who-can-apply/">Health and Care visa route</a> and its implications for the healthcare sector, particularly care homes where many of the lower paid or skilled roles did not fall within scope of this or of the Skilled Worker visa more generally.</p>
<p>The government has now responded to the increasing pressure of widespread staff shortages by adding many of these lower skilled roles to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/statement-of-changes-to-the-immigration-rules-hc-1019-24-january-2022">Shortage Occupation list</a> despite the fact that they still do not recognise these roles as skilled at RQF level 3, which would render them eligible for the Skilled Worker visa. They have been added only to the Shortage Occupation list, and then the rules have been amended to allow lower skilled roles to be sponsored in the event that they are included on the shortage occupation list.</p>
<p>From, 15<sup>th</sup> of February 2022 employers (but not private households looking to bring over an individual for personal care) will be able to sponsor care assistants, home carers, nursing home support workers and other individuals in similar roles provided they meet the salary threshold of at least £20,480. It is likely as well that they will be eligible for the Health and Care visa, exempting applications from the Immigration Skills Charge and the Immigration Health Surcharge as well as entitling them to the lower application fee and faster processing time.</p>
<p>The new SOC (Standard Occupational Classification) code added to this route is 6145 – Care Workers and home carers, with the note that “private households or individuals (other than sole traders sponsoring someone to work for their business) cannot sponsor Skilled Worker applicants. The related job titles are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Care Assistant</li>
<li>Care Worker</li>
<li>Carer</li>
<li>Home Care Assistant</li>
<li>Home Carer</li>
<li>Support Worker (nursing home)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This visa is designed as a temporary solution to ‘alleviate current pressures on the health and social care system as a result of Covid-19’, and for the time being the window for applications is 15/02/2022 – 14/02/2023, however it is unclear what the Home Office will do when reviewing this in February 2023 and there is every possibility that this visa path will end up open indefinitely.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-9691" src="https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/smartphone-1894723_1920-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/smartphone-1894723_1920-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/smartphone-1894723_1920-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/smartphone-1894723_1920-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/smartphone-1894723_1920-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/smartphone-1894723_1920.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a welcome expansion of the UK Immigration: ID Check App, holders of biometric passports from an EU country, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway or Switzerland can now apply using priority service, even if they use the app. Standard processing times for those in the affected visa categories (Skilled Worker, Health and Care Worker, Student) are currently 15 working days, but priority service reduces this to 5 working days, super priority reduces it to 1 working day.</p>
<p>Previously applicants have been forced to choose between attending a centre in order to use priority (or in some limited cases super-priority) or using the app. With centres often very far apart, and in many cases only one centre per country as well as operating on limited hours (sometimes only opening for one morning a week) this renders the priority service almost unusable for many EU applicants.</p>
<p>The ability to enjoy both the convenience of the app, as well as priority service will make a big difference to many applicants. Not only does it remove the need to travel long distances to an application centre, but applicants applying through this method can also retain their passport during the decision making process, and will not need to worry about collecting their BRP as proof of their immigration status will be held digitally.</p>
<p>Not all visa categories can be submitted through the app, with notable exceptions including visit visas and T5 categories, but for applicants on the Skilled Worker, Health and Care worker and Student visa routes, this will be a very welcome development.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-9749 aligncenter" src="https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/lorries-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/lorries-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/lorries-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/lorries-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/lorries-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/lorries.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone who has been in a British supermarket in the past few weeks will be familiar with the sight of bare shelves and poor availability of a variety of products, but this pales in comparison to the fuel shortage. While an argument can be made that both issues have been exacerbated by panic buying, this grim reality of post-Brexit labour shortages provides very real evidence of the impact of the exodus of EU workers, and the impossibilities of filling the vacant roles they left.</p>
<p>A number of industries are struggling, including healthcare and agriculture but the current pressing crisis revolves around a shortage of an estimated 100,000 Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) drivers.</p>
<p>The question is really whether the problems is with failure to recruit, or whether it is with the immigration system. The government is keen to place the blame at the feet of recruitment, claiming that it is the industry’s responsibility to ensure it is competitive and attractive to new workers. Pointing to the substantial number of people still on furlough, it rejects the idea that there are not enough workers available.</p>
<p>On the face of it this seems like a robust argument, if there are those without jobs, and jobs with high number of vacancies then the solution seems simple. The reality of the situation however is much more complex.</p>
<p>The most pressing issue is that the shortage is having impacts on supply chains now, and has been for some time, but despite HGV drivers not being classed as ‘Skilled Workers’ for the purpose of the government’s work visa, this does not mean absolutely anybody can do the job. Driving a lorry, naturally, requires a different skill-set to driving a car, and anybody new to the industry will have to go through a lengthy process of learning to drive. Even if they breeze through this, they face further obstacles to getting qualified due to the huge backlog of tests caused by the pandemic and the suspension of tests during it.</p>
<p>Even those intending to do the job face long waits between starting the recruitment protest and actually getting behind the wheel of the lorry to start making deliveries. Clearly this does nothing to solve our current supply chain woes, and is unlikely to provide a solution to the expected increase in demand related to Christmas.</p>
<p>In an attempt to address this issue, the government has announced 5,000 visas will be available immediately, however only on a temporary basis of a few months. There are several issues with this, the first being the obvious that 5,000 visas is simply not enough to fill a deficit of 100,000. The second is that many drivers feel slighted by the UK and quite rightly are disinclined to leave their jobs and countries to come bail us out. It seems incredibly naïve on the part of the government to assume that EU workers will be champing at the bit to make career sacrifices to save us after we have given them the diplomatic equivalent of the middle finger.</p>
<p>The other obstacle, relating to expecting domestic workers on furlough and the unemployed to fill these vacancies, is that it is unrealistic to expect that all, or even any, of these workers have aspirations to become a HGV driver. The hours are long and unsociable, and the nature of the work is mentally grueling in that it requires a high tolerance for hours of monotony and high focus. The physical demands of the job are also unappealing to many.</p>
<p>It is simply not helpful to live in an idealised fantasy world where large swathes of British and settled workers suddenly decide to realise aspirations to shift from unrelated fields to become lorry drivers. Part of making the job more enticing to new entrants as well would require, and indeed is driving (no pun intended), much higher salaries, but the money to fund this will be passed onto the consumer, seeing us pay more for products. This is also hardly an ideal outcome for the British public.</p>
<p>Mounting pressure on the government for a long term solution has prompted them to make the training process shorter and increase test availability, but this is clearly not an ideal solution. For one thing it raises the question of whether it is appropriate to cut part of the training process in order to bail the government out of this situation it has created for itself. Presumably the initial qualification period was lengthy for a reason, and personally I would like to be reassured that those responsible for operating 40 ton lorries, at speed, on our roads, have had a robust and comprehensive training process, not one which has been cut short in order to save the government face.</p>
<p>It also does little to address the issue that many people simply do not want to be a HGV driver, and with job vacancies at their highest since records began, potential applicants looking to switch careers have a wide range of careers to choose from. It is delusional to gamble the nation’s supply of food, petrol and other essentials on the belief that there are thousands of people eager to retrain as HGV drivers. I am reminded again of the government’s previous out of touch poster suggesting ballerinas might retrain as IT professionals. Their inability to see people as varied and unique instead of just a workforce to be crammed into whatever vacancies exist regardless of individual choice or skill-set will set us on a path for continued labour woes in the years to come.</p>
<p>With the latest shortage and panic buying hitting petrol, and the UK gearing up for another wave of inevitable panic-buying in the run up to Christmas, the government has been forced to bring the military  in to ease pressure and try to get back on top of the crisis. Even as I write this I have struggled for the past week and a half to find fuel. This does not inspire confidence that everything is ‘under control’. Well adjusted immigration policies to not necessitate military intervention to ensure people have access to fuel and food.</p>
<p>The government’s continued argument against allowing migrant HGV drivers to apply for Skilled Worker visas is that they do not want UK and settled workers to be undercut by cheap foreign labour. I do query, when the government has full control over the ‘going rate’ an employer must pay a sponsored migrant worker for any given job, why they do not declare what they determine to be a ‘fair’ rate for an HGV driver and state that anyone hoping to employ one from overseas must pay at least this level.</p>
<p>It works this way for other professions eligible for the Skilled Worker visa, each of which has a going rate that must be paid according to the industry average, so I can see no reason why it wouldn’t be a viable option here. Indeed ‘foreign workers might undercut British workers’ is an argument that can be used for absolutely any career path and I cannot see any reason why HGV drivers should be considered unique. The only explanation I can see is stubborn refusal to face reality as the government cuts off its own nose to spite its face.</p>
<p>They would rather the people they claim to represent suffer food and fuel shortages as well as ridiculously inflated princes for essentials, than admit that we needed EU labour and that our society was reliant on it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3066" src="https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/medic-563425_1280-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/medic-563425_1280-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/medic-563425_1280-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/medic-563425_1280-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/medic-563425_1280.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the shortage of health care workers wreaking havoc on care homes across the country in the wake of Brexit and Covid-19, many care homes may be looking for an answer to their recruitment woes.</p>
<p>The government’s answer to this has been the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/health-care-worker-visa">Health and Care</a> visa, an attractive new route touting fast-track entry (15 working days as opposed to the standard 8 weeks for a Skilled Worker visa), cheaper visa fees, and an exemption from the Immigration Health Surcharge. A number of healthcare professionals, particularly those working for the NHS, are covered but we will be focusing on its application in care homes after it was extended to cover certain professions in the social care sector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Who is Eligible?</strong></p>
<p>For the purpose of this blog, there are a number of Standard Occupation Classification (SOC) codes which are relevant for those hoping to employ staff for care homes. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li>1242 – Residential, day and domiciliary care managers and proprietors</li>
<li>2219 – Health Professionals not elsewhere classified</li>
<li>3219 – Health associate professionals not elsewhere classified</li>
<li>6141 – Nursing auxiliaries and assistants</li>
<li>6146 – Senior care workers</li>
</ul>
<p>Notably absent are care workers below senior or management level. The roles must be at RQF level 3 or above, which is equivalent to UK A-levels. At the time of writing, junior care workers are not considered as having met this threshold.</p>
<p>Applicants under this route will also need to meet all the criteria under the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-skilled-worker">Skilled Worker</a> route including meeting requirements for minimum salary, English proficiency and doing a job on the list of eligible occupations.</p>
<p>In addition they must also be employed by an approved body and which approved body must be made clear on the Certificate of Sponsorship. If the assigning organisation is private, details of the arrangements with the relevant NHS body to which they also provide services must also be provided.</p>
<p>The threshold for income is £20,480 or the ‘going rate’ for the role, whichever is higher. This also excludes many lower paid positions from eligibility.</p>
<p>Applicants and their family members may also need to provide test results from an approved tuberculosis test if they are applying from overseas and resident in certain countries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How do I Employ Someone on this Route?</strong></p>
<p>In order to employ someone under the health and care route, an employer will first need to apply for a sponsor license in the same way as is required for a Skilled Worker visa. We will not go into detail about the process here, but we do offer assistance with applications for both sponsor licenses and the visa application process itself, so if your organisation does not hold one, please do get in touch.</p>
<p>Once the sponsor license has been obtained, the sponsoring organisation will need to issue a Certificate of Sponsorship to the applicant, who will use this to apply for the visa. Details of how the role meets the requirements for the Health and Care route must be included on the Certificate of Sponsorship. Where the organisation provides NHS services, it may also be necessary to provide additional evidence of this with the applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What About Family Members?</strong></p>
<p>Applicants on this route are able to bring dependant family members with them. This may include children under the age of 18, spouses, and unmarried partners living with the main applicant for at least 2 years in a relationship akin to marriage. There is no facility to bring extended family members or adult children in on this route.</p>
<p>Applicants’ dependant family members also enjoy the reduced fees and Immigration Health Surcharge exemption. They must prove their relationship to the main applicant, normally with a birth certificate, marriage certificate or evidence of cohabitation, unless their dependants have had a previous successful application as dependants of the main applicant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How Long will the Visa be for?</strong></p>
<p>The visa can be granted for a maximum of 5 years, with no minimum period, and is indefinitely renewable, the length of the visa is specified when the CoS is issued. If the visa is granted for a shorter period than 5 years, then it will be necessary to renew the visa before it expires in order for the individual to remain working in the UK.</p>
<p>After 5 years on this route, applicants and their dependants will be eligible for Indefinite Leave to Remain in the UK which will grant them the right to stay in the UK indefinitely (subject to some conditions).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How Much does it Cost?</strong></p>
<p>The visa itself is comparatively cost efficient, with an exemption from the costly immigration health surcharge and the immigration skills charge.</p>
<p>The fees differ depending on whether the visa is issued for more or less than 3 years. The costing is also the same for each dependant, regardless of age. There may be a £55 fee reduction for the main applicant’s fee for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/health-care-worker-visa/how-much-it-costs">applicants from certain countries</a>.</p>
<p>Application fee: £232 per applicant (3 years and under)/£464 per applicant (over 3 years)</p>
<p>Biometric enrolment fee: £19.20 per applicant</p>
<p>Biometric appointment fee: Variable, may be free or up to £199 depending on the location.</p>
<p>Certificate of Sponsorship: £199</p>
<p>Applicants may also need to demonstrate financial maintenance if their sponsor does not certify this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3630" src="https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/covid-19-300x201.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="201" srcset="https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/covid-19-300x201.jpg 300w, https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/covid-19-1024x685.jpg 1024w, https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/covid-19-768x514.jpg 768w, https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/covid-19-1536x1027.jpg 1536w, https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/covid-19.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></h1>
<p>With the closure of the EU settlement scheme, employers of EU staff members will now have to perform right to work checks to ensure that their EU workers have acquired the right to work in the UK whether through application to the settlement scheme or otherwise.</p>
<p>With Covid, however, many employees or prospective employees may be self-isolating, working from home, or otherwise unable to come into the office to perform an in person right to work checks.</p>
<p>In addition to the existing right to work check, which is available <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/999119/FINAL_Employers_Guide.pdf">here</a>, there are also a number of Covid concessions in place to allow employers to continue to remain compliant throughout the pandemic. The full document is available <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-right-to-work-checks">here</a> but please see below for a summary.</p>
<p>These concessions are valid until 31/08/2021 at the time of writing (15/07/2021).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Alternative Ways to Check Applicants’ Documents </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Checks can be carried out via video call with the applicant. They should hold their original documents up to the camera so you can check the details against the digital copies they have sent you. In the event that the worker has a Biometric Residence Permit or Card or has status under the EU settlement scheme, you may use the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/view-right-to-work">online right to work checking service</a> while on the video call. The applicant will need to provide their consent for you to view this information.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Applicants may send scans or photographs of their documents via email or a mobile app instead of providing the originals.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Employers should use the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/employee-immigration-employment-status">Employer Checking Service</a> to check the right to work of any applicant or employee who cannot provide suitable documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From September 1<sup>st</sup> 2021 these temporary adjustments will end, and you will need to see applicants’ original documents or check their right to work online, as was the case before the pandemic. There is no need to re-do these checks on individuals who had their right to work check carried out under the temporary concessions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the 24<sup>th</sup> of May 2021 Priti Patel announced a variety of changes to be made in the immigration. The gist of the move is increased digitisation of the border and more accurate tracking of people who enter and exit the UK, there will also be some changes to existing immigration routes, although these do not seem to be on the same level as the government’s total overhaul of the system last year. A summary of the main changes is as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Electronic Travel Authorisation</strong></p>
<p>The government plans to bring in an electronic pre-clearance system for travellers to the UK, whether they are visa nationals or not. Currently nationals of a number of countries (for example countries in the EEA and the USA) are able to travel to the UK without seeking any kind of prior permission to enter. Under the new system, everyone would need to apply for some form of clearance, whether in the form of a full visa, or in the form of an ETA.</p>
<p>The ETAs will reportedly cost £9, a 6 month visit visa currently costs £95 for comparison, but this is yet to be confirmed. This is not a new idea, and it is not likely to be rolled out in the immediate future.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Increased Digitisation</strong></p>
<p>The government is keen to increase digitisation of the systems which verify foreign national’s right to work and live in the UK. Currently most foreign nationals are issued with a biometric residence permit, a physical document they can use to demonstrate their status to employers and landlords. EEA residents with settled or pre-settled status, and some migrants from the EU who applied using the government’s app, are now not issued with any physical document and all checks must be carried out online. The government is looking to expand this system.</p>
<p>It is the long term plan that eventually the majority of biometric information will be given digitally, and that the current entry clearance vignette system will be replaced with E-visas. In the immediate future the Home Office has made the commitment that all border control staff will be able to check if an individual has settled or pre-settled status. This will hopefully reduce the number of issues arising at the border where EEA individuals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Points Based System</strong></p>
<p>The ink is barely dry on the government’s new points based system, but the government is already looking to tweak aspects of the business visas. We are still awaiting details on what exactly this might look like, but the government promises to ‘continue to simplify our Immigration Rules and make them as user-friendly and accessible as possible’ which can only be a good thing.</p>
<p>There are also plans for “Global Business Mobility” visa which is likely to combine several existing routes, including intra-company transfer, representative of an overseas business.</p>
<p>The unsponsored work route for high achievers has also been confirmed, and the current plan is for this to open in early 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-9545" src="https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Blog-09.04-pic-300x179.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="179" srcset="https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Blog-09.04-pic-300x179.jpg 300w, https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Blog-09.04-pic-1024x612.jpg 1024w, https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Blog-09.04-pic-768x459.jpg 768w, https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Blog-09.04-pic-1536x918.jpg 1536w, https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Blog-09.04-pic.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Brexit now in full swing, many EU nationals are now coming up against the UK’s ‘hostile environment’ immigration policy for the first time. Individuals who have previously had no issues coming into the UK have been surprised to find themselves stopped at the border, interrogated, and then promptly detained for removal.</p>
<p>Free movement rights ended on 31/12/2021 at 11pm, meaning visitors from the EU now need to ensure they are compliant with the UK’s rigorous restrictions on permitted activities for visitors. Do not be fooled by the term ‘non-visa national’, just because you do not need a visa does not mean that border control will simply let you into the country to do whatever you want. If you do not hold settled or pre-settled status, you will need to seek entry as a visitor at the border. It is not permitted to enter the country for any other purpose without a visa.</p>
<p>If you are not sure whether you require a visa to visit the UK, the Home Office provides a handy guide <a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-uk-visa">here</a>. EU citizens and other so-called non visa nationals do not need to apply for a visit visa in advance of travel (although may find it helpful to do so if they have adverse immigration history to avoid risking being turned away at the border), but they must normally apply for a visa if they would like to work, study or live in the UK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Who is a Visitor?</strong></p>
<p>Visitors normally enter the UK for a temporary period of time, normally less than 6 months although there are exceptions. There are a number of prohibited activities in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-v-visitor">Appendix V: Visitor</a> which a visitor is not permitted to carry out unless expressly permitted under a separate appendix. These include working, studying, getting married and receiving medical treatment.</p>
<p>If the border officer suspects you are entering the UK to carry out any of these prohibited activities, they have the right to refuse you entry and enforce your return to your country of origin. It is important to be clear on what you are and are not permitted to do in the UK, and to be able to clearly explain at the border what your intentions are, so that there is no doubt about the type of activity you intend to carry out.</p>
<p>Most tourists will have no problems, as tourism and leisure are clearly permitted, but other activities are permitted as a visitor, and this is where things can get a little confusing. Work is a prohibited activity for instance, but what counts as work? Is attending a business meeting working?  Does attending a seminar count as studying? For those with slightly less straightforward purposes, the below list, which is a non-comprehensive summary of some of the more common permitted activities, taken from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-visitor-permitted-activities">Appendix Visitor: Permitted Activities</a> may be helpful.</p>
<ul>
<li>tourism and leisure</li>
<li>visiting friends and family</li>
<li>school exchanges and visits</li>
<li>volunteering for up to 30 days with a registered charity</li>
<li>attend meetings, conferences, seminars, interviews</li>
<li>negotiate and sign deals and contracts</li>
<li>site visits and inspections</li>
<li>intra-corporate activities</li>
<li>interpreting and translation work as an employee of an overseas enterprise</li>
<li>tour group work</li>
<li>journalism</li>
<li>scientific and academic research</li>
<li>preaching and pastoral work by religious workers</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clearly then there are some scenarios in which work and study related activities are permitted, and if you are unsure we highly recommend you seek expert advice before you travel. The exact nature of work which is permitted is very difficult to interpret as a layperson, and can often fall foul of subjective interpretation on the part of the border officer. If your particular activity falls into that murky ambiguous area between ‘worker’ and ‘visitor’, it may be worth applying for a visit visa regardless of the requirement, to avoid the risk of problems upon entry.</p>
<p>Related to employment there are also no express restrictions on visitors seeking employment or even attending job interviews, although they should under absolutely no circumstances start doing any actual work should they be successful. They will need to leave the UK and reapply under the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa">Skilled Worker scheme</a> in order to take up employment.</p>
<p>It is also not prohibited for visitors to work remotely while in the UK for their overseas employer (for example by responding to emails), however this should not be the primary purpose of the visit as it is not on the list of permitted activities which should form the primary basis for a visit to the UK. This means it would be ok to answer a few work emails while visiting a family member in the UK, but not to visit the UK for the sole purpose of working remotely from the UK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How Do Border Officers Decide?</strong></p>
<p>At the border, a border officer will assess the purpose of the proposed visit and make a decision as to whether it falls within permitted visitor activities or not. They will ask you questions about your reasons for visiting the UK, and it is important to answer honestly and in a way which makes it clear your visit falls within the permitted guidelines.</p>
<p>The decision will be made on the balance of probability and depend on whether the officer thinks it is more likely than not that you are a genuine visitor. This is a subjective decision against which there is no right of appeal, and there is therefore the potential for inconsistencies in decision making between border officers.</p>
<p>If the officer wants to talk to you, they will look at things like the main reason for your visit, your immigration history and any problems you have had, how many visits you have been making to the UK (are you trying to live here by visiting repeatedly), whether you have family in the UK, your ties to your home country, whether you booked a return flight, and how much money you have. These are issues it is helpful to have thought about and have an answer for in advance.</p>
<p><strong>How Long Can I Stay?</strong></p>
<p>As a non-visa national you can stay six months at a time from the date of entry. There is no formal ‘cooling off’ period before you can re-enter the UK, but attempts to live in the UK through repeated visits will arouse suspicion. A good rule of thumb is not to spend more than 180 days in any 12 month period in the UK.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-9696 aligncenter" src="https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/india-26828_1280-300x200.png" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/india-26828_1280-300x200.png 300w, https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/india-26828_1280-1024x682.png 1024w, https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/india-26828_1280-768x512.png 768w, https://sunicoimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/india-26828_1280.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
<p>As part of a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-india-agree-partnership-to-boost-work-visas-for-indian-nationals">new agreement with India</a>, the UK government has agreed (albeit in a non-binding agreement) to participate in a scheme aimed at allowing increased mobility for a limited number of young people between India and the UK. It has some similarities to the existing <a href="https://www.gov.uk/youth-mobility">Youth Mobility Scheme</a>, and will allow up to 3,000 Indian nationals per year aged between 18 and 30 to come to the UK to live and work for a period of up to two years. In return, 3,000 UK nationals a year will be able to do the same in India.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Who can apply?</strong></p>
<p>Unlike the Youth Mobility Scheme, which has no qualification or English language requirements, hopeful applicants under the Young Professionals scheme will have to hold a diploma or degree equivalent to at least three years of higher education and be able to express themselves in the language of the host country.</p>
<p>It is also possible that the visa could require sponsorship or a job offer from a named employer, which would distinguish it from the un-sponsored Youth Mobility Scheme route, however the eligibility requirements have not yet been finalised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How will the 3,000 be picked?</strong></p>
<p>This is not yet clear. It is likely that this visa will be over-subscribed, with millions of Indian nationals meeting the eligibility requirements. In this case it is likely that there will be a lottery for places, as in some countries for the Youth Mobility visa where places are heavily limited. There are also concerns that this category may be dominated by large tech companies, which will gain a monopoly on the limited spaces available, if it offers a cheaper way to bring talent into the UK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Due to increased demand for replacement Biometric Residence Permits and Cards the Home Office’s commercial partner UKVCAS has been struggling with appointment availability for all applicants. In order to reduce the pressure, it has been announced that <a href="https://www.ukvcas.co.uk/flash-message-detail?flashmessageId=74833">as of 22/04/2021 some BRP/BRC replacement customers will be invited to apply through the IDV app.</a></p>
<p>When applicants submit an application in this category UKVI will assess whether the application can be progressed using the app. If so, they will contact you by email with instructions on using the app, if not, they will let you know and invite you to book an appointment through UKVCAS.</p>
<p>UKVCAS have indicated the assessment process should be carried out within a few weeks of registration with UKVI. This means you should create an account by following the instructions to provide biometrics after submitting the online application. Once an account is created you should await further instructions.</p>
<p>The email will be sent to the email you registered your application with and will be titled “Book your UKVCAS appointment now” or “Download the IDV app now”</p>
<p>In addition to this, UKVCAS have now started sending emails after applicants for all visa categories attend a biometric appointment confirming that supporting information has been sent to UKVI. This email will be entitled ‘Your supporting information has been submitted to UKVI’ and will be sent to the email account you registered to UKVCAS with. It should arrive within 24 hours of the appointment.</p>
